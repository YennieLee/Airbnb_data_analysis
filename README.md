# Airbnb_data_analysis

### üîç Overview

This project aims to help **Airbnb** establish a business strategy through data-driven analysis.

First, I explored what defines *high-quality accommodations*. Since guests determine whether a stay is great or not, I focused on **review scores**. By identifying which factors influence these scores, I defined the key elements that make a great listing.

Second, I conducted **NLP analysis** to pinpoint specific issues. Using topic modeling, I identified areas that need improvement and developed actionable ideas.

Third, I applied **machine learning** to optimize Airbnb listing prices based on a wide range of features.

Finally, I designed a **prototype service** to help Airbnb hosts maximize their profit.

### üìä EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The goal of EDA was to identify the factors that make listings successful.

Since **review scores** directly reflect guest satisfaction, I analyzed patterns in the scoring system.

Airbnb reviews consist of one **overall rating** and six **detailed category scores**: accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value.

Importantly, the overall score is **not** a simple average of the detailed scores.

Key findings:

1. The distributions of **overall**, **cleanliness**, and **value** scores were wider than others ‚Äî showing more variability among listings.

2. **Private listings** had higher average scores than shared ones.
   <img width="790" height="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8001ad0-9028-44d1-ba27-b72ee886ea45" />

3. Listings with **more amenities** tended to have slightly higher scores, though the effect was not strong.

4.  From regression analysis, **value** and **cleanliness** were the two most influential factors affecting the overall score.

üëâ Based on these results, I focused on **price (value)** and **cleanliness** for deeper analysis and actionable insights.

### üí¨ NLP Analysis

To address cleanliness-related issues, I conducted text mining using 1,000 posts from the official **Airbnb Host Community Forum** containing the keyword *‚Äúcleaning.‚Äù*

Using **LDA topic modeling**, I identified two main discussion themes:

1. Disputes between hosts and guests regarding **cleaning fees**
2. Hosts **seeking recommendations** for reliable cleaning companies

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db694f6-1260-4296-abdd-36d852c43d39" alt="image1"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/483f5da5-78fd-40ab-aa28-4f1f00e2f099" alt="image2"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d87fea16-19f8-407a-9217-60c15ead9918" alt="image3"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>



These results suggested that many hosts struggle to find trusted cleaning services and spend excessive time managing this task.

üí° **Action item:** *‚ÄúAirbnb Clean Partners‚Äù*

A **cleaning company brokerage service** where Airbnb partners with verified cleaning providers.

Hosts can simply select a preferred cleaning company on their dashboard, and Airbnb handles the rest.

This service would:

- üìà Generate **additional revenue** for Airbnb (commission from cleaning services)
- ‚è∞ **Save hosts‚Äô time** in finding cleaners
- ‚ú® **Improve guest satisfaction** through consistent cleanliness standards

### ü§ñ Machine Learning

Since **price** significantly affects review scores, I built a model to help hosts set reasonable, data-driven prices.

### üîß ML Process

1. **Preprocessing**
    - Removed unnecessary columns
    - Filtered inactive hosts using the `availability_365` column
        - `365` ‚Üí never booked (too expensive or inactive host)
        - `0` ‚Üí fully booked or temporarily blocked
        - Both considered inactive and removed
2. **Derived Features**
    - **`nearby_avg_price`**: average price within 1 km (to reflect local market trends)
    - **`has_amenity`**: boolean columns indicating whether a listing includes specific amenities
        - Amenities were grouped into:
            - *Core essentials* (e.g., kitchen, Wi-Fi, heating)
            - *Nice-to-have comforts* (e.g., balcony, parking, TV)
            - *Target-specific* (e.g., crib, workspace, pet-friendly)
        - Columns with low statistical significance were excluded via t-tests.
3. **Data Splitting**
    - 80% training / 20% testing
4. **Missing Value Imputation**
    - Imputed `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `beds` using group means by `accommodates`
    - Imputed host-related features (acceptance, response, review scores) by `host_is_superhost`
5. **Encoding**
    - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features (`room_type`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, `nearest_center`)
6. **Scaling**
    - Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
7. **Log Transformation**
    - Applied log transformation to `price` to reduce skewness
      
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735daff4-9dee-4f53-bac4-4be29ede8e4e" alt="image1"></td>

9. **Base Model Optimization**
    - Tuned hyperparameters using **Optuna** for efficiency over grid/random search
10. **Meta Model Selection**
    - Compared Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest as meta models
    - Chose **Gradient Boost** for its strong performance with log-transformed targets

        - MAE: ~650
        - R¬≤: ~0.683

### üìà Model Insights

1. **Feature Importance:**
    - Top 3: `availability_365`, `host_duration`, `nearby_avg_price`
    - Interpretation: booking activity, host experience, and local market influence price.
      
      <img width="790" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2504bf45-0055-4e05-a1e0-c65a4515e057" />

2. **Permutation Importance:**
    - Top 3: `accommodates`, `nearby_avg_price`, `booking_rate`
    - Interpretation: size, local market, and popularity predict price accuracy.
      
      <img width="790" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9925a5-fe46-4130-9cc0-08d4744157f0" />

3. **SHAP Values:**
    - Positive correlation: `accommodates`, `nearby_avg_price`
    - Negative correlation: `booking_rate`, `number_of_reviews`
    - Interpretation: larger or better-located listings cost more, while overly expensive ones tend to have lower bookings and reviews.
      
      <img width="781" height="740" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52a9fe3-4809-4c32-aa7c-d4e3b5b8f4ff" />
        
‚úÖ This model helps hosts **set data-informed prices**, improving perceived *value* and *review scores*.

### üí° Prototype Service

Based on the machine learning insights, I found a clear tendency that listings with certain amenities tend to have higher prices on average.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d22f8d07-1fd6-4789-bea6-e1b4151ade92" alt="image1"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd6c9be-830c-48eb-ae10-f8fb12b95b61" alt="image2"></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ce760c-3402-4196-9234-9beeaad958c7" alt="image3"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

Using these findings, I designed a prototype web service that provides hosts with an ‚Äúinsight report‚Äù ‚Äî showing how small upgrades can increase their potential revenue.

Through this service, hosts can:
- Input their listing details
- Receive a data-driven recommended price
- Simulate how adding specific amenities would affect profit
- Compare price gaps with similar listings that already have those amenities

This tool helps hosts boost both revenue and listing quality through data-informed improvements.
