Michael5778,27-06-2021 12:55 PM,"Arlington, VA","It is absolutely ridiculous Airbnb does not have an option for a pet cleaning fee.  You can charge for an extra human, but not a animal that leaves 10 pounds of fur behind and slobbered everywhere for 3 days.  Makes NO sense.    I now have one cleaner, after each stay with a dog, dedicated to cleaning up dog hair and I am very close to not allowing dogs.   How do you charge a guest for the extra time and in my case, person, that has to clean up after the dog?    Does anyone not allow dogs?             "
Adrienne174,03-05-2021 04:07 AM,N/A,"I am new as a Abnb host and I am wondering how do I go about handling the cleaning especially bathroom when I am hosting two different guests at the same time. I live on premise however we love being on the go and leave guests giving them the experience of having the house to themselves. I noticed that as the guests used the bathroom particular the shower it’s need cleaning you clearly see a ring and hair left behind, I do not want the next guest having to shower or take a bath after a guest and clearly see the tub needs cleaning. Any ideas?   When I am hosting two different guest I will not leave to go about my business so I can get the bathroom cleaned if needed. I do not charge a cleaning fee FYI...   I am anal about my cleaning just like others (I clean myself no problem on my end to do it) however I do want to still have a life but I cannot figure out how to get it clean unless I have the guess do it.   Thanks"
Sarah5000,23-06-2025 09:07 PM,"Adelaide, Australia","Last weekend, I watched a Japanese TV show about cleaning—and to my surprise, it moved me deeply.   One line from the show especially stayed with me: “Cleaning is integral for maintaining and enhancing the appeal of Kyoto’s traditional atmosphere.” Another was: “Cleaning every nook and cranny is a fundamental part of hospitality. Without that, we cannot offer guests the next level of hospitality.”   It reminded me so much of my own journey as a host. I started hosting back in 2015 and, like many of us in the early days, I did everything myself—including the cleaning. Every detail mattered. I still remember the moment a guest once told me, “I own a cleaning company, and I couldn’t fault the cleanliness of your apartment.” That was one of the greatest compliments I’ve ever received. It wasn’t just about being clean—it was about the care, the pride, and the intention behind it.   In the same show, they talked about how in Kyoto, thoughtful cleaning isn’t just about making a space look good—it’s a quiet gesture of respect. It nurtures good relationships with neighbors and strengthens the sense of community. Zen Buddhists even consider cleaning to be on the same level as zazen—meditative sitting. It’s seen as part of a monk’s daily training. That really resonated with me. Over the years, I’ve also come to realize that “clean” can mean different things to different people. What feels sparkling to one person may not meet the standards of another. I once learned a great tip from a fellow host at a meetup: create a cleaning and preparation checklist. It wasn’t about micro-managing cleaners—it was about setting a shared standard and showing guests that every detail has been considered with care.   Now, whether I clean myself or have a trusted team help me, that checklist serves as our quiet promise to the next guest: “We prepared this space with love and intention.” I hope you get the chance to watch that show, and that it reminds you—like it reminded me—that the smallest actions, like wiping down a surface or straightening a cushion, can be acts of deep hospitality.   I'd love to hear your own cleaning rituals or tips. What’s something you do that makes your space feel extra special?

The way the estate charges for cleaning and laundry is a flat fee for cleaning, and then a rate per bed for the laundry.  My experience as a cleaner in Europe was an hourly rate for cleaning and the washing and ironing.  (Whilst you are cleaning, you are doing the washing of the linen and towels, and then an hourly rate for the ironing - so I can’t understand the rate per bed on top of the hourly rate).

They are due to leave this Friday and I was told they may stay for another 7 days again. They are asking if anyone would be over to clean. I replied saying that if they would like a cleaning I could have someone out to clean but it would be an additional cleaning fee since the initial cleaning fee charge was for the initial booking and didn't take into consideration the long term stay.

Jemmelia0,25-03-2025 02:21 PM,"Brampton, Canada","Hi everyone,   As an Airbnb host, one of the most important aspects to focus on is creating a welcoming, clean environment for guests. Here are a few simple cleaning tips to ensure your guests have a fantastic experience: 1. Tackle the High-Traffic Areas – Pay special attention to spots that guests are most likely to touch, like light switches, remote controls, and door handles. 2. Use Fresh Scents – A light, fresh scent can make your space feel more inviting. Consider using eco-friendly air fresheners or essential oils. 3. Focus on the Bathrooms – Ensure the bathroom is spotless with fresh towels and properly sanitized surfaces. A clean bathroom can be a game changer. 4. Create a “Homey” Feel – Small touches like fluffy pillows or a cozy throw blanket can make your space feel like a true retreat for your guests.   By keeping your space clean and organized, you’ll build a reputation for being a thoughtful and attentive host.   Have any other cleaning tips you’d recommend? I’d love to hear them!"

Patrice513,16-04-2025 10:46 AM,"Pennsylvania, United States","Hi everyone,   I'm a relatively new, remote host and would love to get some perspective on my cleaning process. I've been actively hosting for the past two months and have a local co-host who handles post-cleaning/pre-check inspections and emergencies.   For my 2-bedroom, 1-bath property, I currently use Turno and have adapted one of their checklists. A key part of this checklist is a request for pre-cleaning photos of all rooms. My intention is to get a clear understanding of the state the property was left in, check if guest instructions were followed, and identify any potential missing or damaged items before cleaning begins. This was discussed upfront with both cleaning teams I've worked with and agreed upon to accommodate the request.   Interestingly, both my first and current cleaning teams have expressed resistance once cleaning projects have started to providing these pre-cleaning photos. I've reviewed and refined my checklist to ensure it's clear and manageable, as I'm definitely open to feedback and streamlining the process. However, as a remote host, these initial photos feel crucial for me to have a visual of the property before it's cleaned.   I'm wondering if other hosts or cleaners have experience with this? Is requesting pre-cleaning photos an unreasonable expectation? Any insights or advice you can share from either the host or cleaner perspective would be greatly appreciated. I'm really trying to understand this from all angles and find a solution that works for everyone.   Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"
Autumn63,04-04-2025 07:16 PM,"Lake Arrowhead, CA","Hello,   I have been hosting for five years and currently hold a rating of 4.99 based on 177 reviews and counting. Recently, I’ve noticed a decrease in bookings, which seems to be related to how fees are displayed. Many guests have reached out, mentioning that the nightly rate appears too high.   While I understand the necessity of posting the total cost, the way it is currently formatted can be misleading. For instance, our nightly rate is $189.00, but when potential guests scroll through listings, they see a total of $392.00. This creates confusion and likely contributes to the loss of bookings.   I’ve added a note to the description indicating that the cleaning fee is included in the nightly rate, but many guests still do not grasp this information unless they click on the listing.

Matu25,09-03-2024 04:25 PM,"Philadelphia, PA","Hi all,   I am a new host and am having some issues with pricing and cleaning fees. My property is nice, and I believe my price is reasonable; my guests seem to agree as well. Initially, I did not include a cleaning fee in my cost because I did the cleaning myself. I realized that I couldn't keep up with cleaning up after each guest while also having a lot of other responsibilities. I hired a cleaner for the first time, and they did a fantastic job. I want to keep this level of cleanliness. However, after paying the cleaner, I am left with very little. I do not include my cleaning fee in my listing because the cost of cleaning at each turnover is so high that I will not make much money. I want to either raise the price of my listing or charge a cleaning fee, but I'm concerned that it will be too expensive for guests - I'm about to add a third room, which will raise the cost of my listing. I'm not sure what to do to attract guests, cover cleaning fees, and generate income. Your feedback and suggestions  will be highly appreciated. Thanks!"

If a host charges a guest a cleaning fee (not small at $200 here in SF), what is the cleaning expectation of guests?

Anna10179,17-07-2021 05:17 PM,N/A,"... Still struggling with this issue.   I'm sharing a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo with a host who rents it with her husband, and her toddler. The ad did not promise private washroom. However, there is 1 washroom in the common area, and 1 in their room. Host and family use ""my"" washroom (only toilet and sink) from time to time, however, I'm the only one expected to clean it. host also complains sometimes when it's not up to par clean. I would like to clean at my own pace... So it's kinda like ""MY"" washroom when it comes to cleaning, but shared when it comes to using. I feel like things should either be private fully, or shared fully.    I'm bothered by this. This condo is worth about 2400, and my host gets 1100 from me (after all Airbnb fees).  I'm struggling right now to find another place. I make about 1500 a month, but choose to spend majority on rent, because I wanna live in a nice setting. I sacrifice my grocery bill for that. After all, I start to feel like I'm wasting money, like I'm being ""f'ed over"". Finding it hard yet to find a new place.   I just wanna live nicely and feel like I have a HOME, instead of being told when to clean, like I'm freeloading or smth. Also, there is no cleaning fee for my last month. (but there was one when I moved it - I booked month by month) Any opinion on that? From anybody I haven't heard from. "

We have a fairly high cleaning fee of $225 because we are set up for 14 guests and we have outsourced cleaning and laundry. We had some pretty steep discounts already because of the upcoming unbooked weekend. As you can imagine, it was a pretty big disappointment to realize we lost out on 40% of our take home income.   After looking into it, I realized there's a new ""short-term"" cleaning fee. AirBnB set this to $0 without our knowledge! We spoke to AirBnB support but were told ""we make changes all the time and it's your responsibility to watch for them.""   We quickly updated our cleaning fee, but now we're out of pocket $235.   I actually like the ability to vary the fee to make short stays more appealing but I'm shocked by how we were treated. Did anyone else have this happen to them? Was I the only one not aware?"

The listing does state in its description that they required such cleaning deposit, but I only discovered the standard they require at check in.   Myself I do not charge cleaning fee from guests and my expectation is that guests tidy up but the cleaning between guests is my responsability and it is embodied in the nightly rate.   I did clean the apartment as requsted and received back the cleaning deposit.

The bedroom also has a WB fireplace but if I use it, I am supposed to clean THAT out, too!  Keep in mind this host charged me $145 a day to stay here PLUS $120 Cleaning Fee for only 5 days.  I should not have to clean ANYTHING.  And I'm not staying in a mansion, it's an old farm house.    I also take issue with the fact that ""Clean this before you leave"" lists are not revealed until AFTER I have reserved a place and paid money for a NON-REFUNDABLE STAY.  I think any judge in any court would throw that out the window.  I am coming to a bnb either to relax, visit someone, or get my work done. Not to do yours.   I am planning to go back to staying in hotels after my current reservations because they do not ask me to do their jobs when I leave.    I am sharing my opinions  (and bewilderment) as a guest.  Will somebody please explain to me why hosts want to take my money for cleaning and then they want me to do all that cleaning, too?  There is no way to email Airbnb and ask them or suggest they require hosts to post Clean this before you leave lists up front before we make a reservation.    This all strikes me as a very unjust system.            "
Martin970,15-05-2023 04:47 PM,"Denver, CO","My housekeeper who is really amazing and I've been using for about a year without issues just asked if she could burn some sage after the current guests check out and before the next guests check-in on the same day. She said that after the last clean, she saw something that really freaked her out and is now asking if she could burn sage in my place. I want her to be comfortable, of course, but I have concerns. I have never burned sage so I do not know what it smells like or how long the smell lingers. Thus, I am worried because I don't know how it will affect the next guest. Will they like the smell of burnt sage or will they hate it? Will it smell like something is burning? Will these issues cause them to leave a bad review because of the smell? Will they be as superstitious as my housekeeper and wonder ""hmmm, is there something I should be worried about with this place because the host clearly burned sage in here"" and leave a bad review due to ""spirits in the home"" or something like that. I also don't want to offend my housekeeper and I do want her to be comfortable (she really is outstanding otherwise). I also have a no smoking and no burning of candles house rule for guests so I wouldn't be OK with a guest doing this, but the housekeeper is a different situation. One thing that might affect my decision is the fact that I do have a fireplace in my unit so while I don't allow smoking or candles, I do let guests use duraflame fire log during their stay (which doesn't leave a lingering smell for too long so it's usually totally fine before the next guest arrives, but sage lingers much longer and that is a worry).  It is possible the new guests might simply think ""Oh, the previous guest must have used the fireplace and that's OK"" since I advertise the fireplace heavily on my listing. I may be overthinking this whole thing, I just (a) don't want my new guests to have a bad experience and complain and leave a bad review but also (b) I want my housekeeper to be comfortable and I don't want her to quit because she is superstitious and scared of my place. I don't believe in any of that stuff, but it's not my comfort I am concerned with here so that's irrelevant. My concern is the comfort of my guests and my housekeeper. Any advice?"

I also have 2 Places in Maryland and am working on purchasing a 2nd in Rio Grande or Luquillo PR, plus I am thinking about making a permanent move to PR. My question is for other hosts in PR. Do you have cleaning services for your places? I’m always struggling to find good responsible cleaners. I pay well, I supply Costco memberships to my full time cleaners, and more but, I still struggle. I’m thinking of opening a Cleaning service on the North East Side, to start, where I can not only supply cleaning people but also linens for beds & baths. Cleaners would change all linens with fresh, bring the dirty linens to an office where the linens would be washed by another crew and shelved for the next cleaning. Hotel linens of sheets, pillow cases, towels, wash clothes, enough for each bed and number of people associated with a property. King, Queen, Full, Twin. Would this interest AirBnB hosts in that area?"

My current guests have extended their stay and may extend close to Christmas. I have been providing clean bedding but now they are also requesting cleaning on a weekly basis.

A 15% discount has been added to our already low prices for the longer stay. What is a fair price to ask for fresh bedding and cleaning? Your advice would be much appreciated. Many thanks Sophie."

We find that no matter how good a cleaner may be, they're never, ever going to be as good as us! We all wish our cleaners cared as much as we do but they just simply don't. The little things that getting missed by our cleaners are shockingly obvious to us as owners because we look for everything! Deep Cleaning: Why We Still Do It Ourselves (And You Might Want To, Too) Let’s be real—no matter how reliable your cleaners are, they’ll never care quite like you do.

And once you start noticing them, you can’t unsee them. Pro tip: do the Flashlight Test.
Wait until nightfall, turn off all the lights, and shine a flashlight across the floors, baseboards, or behind furniture. It’s absolutely wild how much grime and dust you’ll spot that’s completely invisible during the day. We do this regularly—and trust us, it’ll change how you clean (and how you inspect).

ShirleyandWarren0,21-08-2020 08:51 AM,"Durban, South Africa",Hi everyone in the community.   We have some guests we are hosting in our home who are providing some challenges. We live in a different city and have a house keeper who lives on the property and does the cleaning once guests leave. Prior to COVID19 we did more short term stays. With COVID19 we have had longer stays. We clearly advertise ourselves as self catering. With COVID19 it would be risky for our housekeeper to clean when guests are in the house. As such we have advised the guests that we cannot provide a cleaning service. We do provide fresh linens every week. We have provided the guests with all the utensils and liquids necessary to self clean. The guests are now being abusive to our housekeeper. Last week the guests messaged me to advise me of a short list of items that needed attention. Being the great hosts we are I traveled up and fixed a dripping tap and tightened two screws that were a bit loose in a door. I fully expect a poor review from these guests despite having excellent (5 stars) reviews from prior guests. I think these guests would be better suited to staying in a lodge or hotel. Any sound advise on this?

I hope you’re having a great week!   Cleaning between guests isn’t always as quick as we hope.   Sometimes it’s a smooth one-hour reset, sheets changed, bathroom scrubbed, a quick vacuum. Other times, it takes much longer, especially if guests left things messy or if you’re extra thorough with the details. Some hosts do it all themselves, while others rely on cleaners.    How long does it really take you to clean your space?   I’m looking forward to reading your thoughts!   Warm regards,

Clean your windows to let in more sunshine, and give your appliances a deep clean—wipe down the fridge, oven, and microwave. Freshen up your soft furnishings by washing curtains, cushions, and even rugs.   What’s on your ultimate spring cleaning checklist?

We are guests at the Jersey Shore where people come for an overnight at the beach all the time yet we also have guests come for several days.  We would love to see a cleaning fee based on the number of days as we don't want to overcharge those coming mainly to sleep while spending all their time at the beach verses those who come to lounge for days on their mini retreat.  We feel a $25 to $50 slide would be fair.  We understand that the cleaning standards have increased due to Covid.  We are not referring to covid sanitation of wiping door handles, light switches, etc.  It's more how longer stays make for more cleaning in general, like cleaning the fridge out, lots of trash from days of takeout, the replacement of all additional use of toiletries, and all the special things we provide that takes much more time to replace.  The longer people stay, the more comfortable they get and the more work needs to be done.    Are there any other hosts who agree with us on this? "

Maria481,21-10-2023 07:26 AM,"SF, CA",I had three instances now where guests were not charged my cleaning fee even though I always have this feature turned on regardless of the length of stay. For the first case it was a listing I've had for years and have always charged a cleaning fee. I got two bookings in a row where the cleaning fee ($175) was not charged to the guest and my booking was only $95. After Airbnb took their fees out I lost about $75. It happened the second time while I was waiting for Airbnb to resolve the issue. In either case they didn't reimburse me and said that I turned this feature on. I couldn't even find the feature and seeing that it took the customer service person 2 days to figure out what was going on it's very cryptic!! I don't know if the platform is sneaking this feature in and turning it on without host's approval. It happened again with a new listing I created. I am now short over $500 because of this feature that I would never use.

Denise1651,27-07-2023 06:20 PM,"Minneapolis, MN","Hi everybody. We started Airbnb about two years ago and have been unsatisfied with the cleaning companies. We’ve worked with so far. Wondering how to screen and identify a good company.
The first company we went with we’re doing all the laundry but we purchased the sheets. We started getting some comments from our guests that the sheets were looking worn so I asked to do an inventory and go through each item one by one so I would know which ones I needed to replace. At first the cleaning company said, our laundry was on the mainland, a week later, they said they couldn’t find it, and it had been misplaced, and when I finally insisted, they said they didn’t want to work with us anymore. Now the second company we went with we’ve been consistently getting a three or a four on the reviews for cleaning. I’ve bought extra tea towels, and they often forget to leave them out or to leave toilet paper in the bathrooms. And yesterday when I asked what time they would be cleaning because our guests wondered if a late check out would be possible, the cleaning crew replied “I’m beginning to believe we’re not a good fit, we need a 36 hour notice for a late check out. I said no problem I was just asking what time you were arriving  because if you’re not coming exactly at 11 I’ll let the guests stay longer. The guests left at 11 and now it’s 6 PM and the cleaners still haven’t shown up so they would’ve had no trouble staying later. It’s very frustrating. Wondering if anyone else has had similar issues. We have a three bedroom  and pay£ 150 a turnover. "

Vinnie1,12-03-2024 03:13 AM,"Fairfax, VA","Hello All, I had made a reservation for 3 nights, a few days later I realized I had a conflict and needed to modify my reservation down to 2 nights. But Airbnb, not the host, is claiming that the Cleaning Fee is none refundable, so I am shy of $100 of a night stay because of that. The total for 3 nights is $600, so the nightly rate would be $200, now I am only getting $100 back. Do you believe the cleaning fee should be evenly calculated and refunded based off of the number of nights of the reservation or is it ok to charge a flat rate for cleaning fee and not have it be refundable?    Also, does anyone know if there was a policy change Airbnb made to hide cleaning fees during the booking and only show it in the receipt once the reservation is made?

Jill41,09-05-2016 02:04 PM,"Hove, United Kingdom","I have just had a guest who left unwashed crockery, one of the toilets was disgusting, wet towels everywhere, duvets on floor, gas hob thick with grease and dirty greasy kitchen surfaces. I wrote a neutral review saying they were friendly and communicated well before the hosting. I choose to let him know privately that I was surprised at how the apartment was left but made it friendly and offering understanding if there had been a problem but I got this back   'Did you really expect us to clean the house before leaving? I think you don't even know what kind of service you are offering. Airbnb is about renting your house as a Hotel, It is not like couch surfing, where people do it for free. I paid more than 400 € for only 3 nights in your old apartment and after that amount of money, that is almost a robbery for the quality of the flat, you are cheeky enough to tell me about the cleaning? You are charging almost a half monthly salary for only 3 nights, you must be able to clean it after all. We didn't break anything, but as you should understand like when I go to a hotel I don't care about tidying or cleaning, because I don't have to do it. .....the house full of boxes everywhere, and the bathrooms were pretty dirty when we came in. So please, stop saying bull**bleep**, take your money that you probably don't even pay taxes for that and this business is totally under the table and don't text me again. I will tell you again just to make it clear, when you pay such a crazy amount of money for a renting, you don't have to clean after being in the house, you must take care like we did and don't break anything.'   The apartment is professionally cleaned in between each guest and the bathrooms are spotless so he has lied about that. I don't charge a cleaning fee. There are no boxes laying around and there is no smell - so my question is this - how should a guest be expected to leave a rental? Everyone else who has stayed has said the apartment is really clean and have left it fine. I expect to have to clean but not this level, am I expecting too much from my guests?    He left me a great review.   Thanks for any advice so i can put it on my hosting:)"
Anand247,15-10-2023 10:33 PM,"Indiana, United States","I recently was a no show at a booking I made.  I actually messaged the host and requested if I could cancel and then clicked through the stupid cancel labyrinth in the AirBnB portal.  It seems I did not follow through enough clicking.  THe reservation was not canceled.  So it was a no show until I saw the next day that the host had messaged me saying that I had not canceled.  I canceled properly at that time going through all their seeming 23 steps.  The host then proceeded to charge me cleaning fees.  How fair is this?  I did not even stay at the place and she can charge me cleaning fees?  Let me not mention that out of a total of $300 approx, she charged me $188.xx.  When I asked her for details, she said it was AirBnB charges and then blocked me from messaging her anymore and I was not even allowed to write a review.  Again, how fair is this?  It seems that AirBnB allows hosts to set their own cancellation policies and it seems its common for the hosts to charge 2 nights when you cancel without notice.  In my case, I did tell her I was not coming, when I did not reply to her message she could have contacted AirBnB help and asked them to call me.  Instead she just conveniently swallowed the $188.x.  THis Cancel gremlin has bitten me thrice now, you think you have canceled - actually the UI makes you think (I guess this is a feature to make canceling a costly experience) you have canceled but hosts would contact me and tell me that they are unable to refund since my canceling did not come through.  I have asked AirBnB help to fix this.  when you cancel Hotel bookings they do not take you through multiple steps and multiple questions before canceling your booking, why should AirBnB be special here?  If we are within our rights to cancel PER THE HOST POLICY then we should be allowed to cancel with a single click without all this brouhaha about ""please tell your host why you cannot make it"". "

Sophey0,10-11-2023 10:21 PM,N/A,"Hi Hosts,   Looking researching for a cleaner who also does laundry included in their service fee.  Background:  I love my cleaner, super good, attentive to details, response and correct problems quickly when it's pointed out...she's quite ethical and reliable, however, she does not have time and is not her service to do laundry.  I'm really torn and really DON'T want to let her go, but I'm getting to a point where having the two separate services is eating all the profits...literally.   Any Bay Area hosts here that love their cleaners, who also does laundry,  would be open to sharing their resource?  And can you provide a price range they charge you and your square footage?   Does the fee include materials...ie. they bring their own cleaning products, machines, etc.  As for laundry, do they do it at your house?  If so, I assume you provide the detergents/dryer sheets all materials to get the job done.  Or take it home/away then bring it back another day?    Any insights you can share, I would really appreciate it."

I created this manually and they prefer to have any updates added to that table with the email resent and the change highlighted.  I'm decent with basic automation and trying to think how I could scrape confirmation emails or the AirBnB calendar to append to the existing table in email and have it resent each time there is a new booking, change or cancelation.

Kenneth12,01-08-2020 11:30 PM,"Chicago, IL","Three stays in a row,   all listings featured enhanced cleaning protocols:

1)  Host says apartment will be ready at 2pm.    Host and friend in apartment at 2:30pm until after 3:15p fooling with equipment in one bedroom.  Host & freind exit via kitchen,   where they take things out of refrigerator cabinets etc.;   no gloves etc;  pretty clear no enhanced cleaning or disinfecting because *no cleaning products in sight*.  (This host has 1800 reviews for multiple properties).

2) ""New French host.""    (The one who has no one to bring keys for days;   also had no check-out plan).    In apartment at check-in.   No gloves,  clearly no protocols from state of things (food left open in refrigerator etc);  insists on showing apartment despite checking off contactless check-in.    Ditto cleaning products.

3) Italian hosts running multiple rooms around city.    Self-check in instructions revealed as ""meet host in person"" 24 hours in advance;   meet in entryway to building,  insist on taking us up one-by-one on a small elevator.   Enter apartment,   host takes mask off;   host enters apartment at other times!;   host and cleaner or assistant enter apartment without notice without masks (aren't mobile cams great?).   (I haven't checked what they have in the cleaning cabinet;  it's possiblethey cleaned beforehand,  but are taking back-to-back reservations at this point).

To be frank,  I don't know where to begin,   but based on this limited experience,   the protocols are just check boxes and a significant number of hosts are just going through them without reading (hey,  I noticed that you have to agree to a contactless check-in!). 

How the heck are same-day turns being allowed?!!?  for that matter.   We are doing very well in Italy and France,   but continuing to do so requires care and vigilance.   The above aren't it.

This is disappointing and concerning (not to start on some behaviors I've seen in Milano in the past days-- my grandfather's temper and some of his most pointed Italian phrases,   almost came out for some teenagers on the subway today).   

Equally,  though,   as a guest,   I chose and paid for those services and there's a problem when those services are not delivered,  at all."

Unfortunately 2 months ago over a year into our trip my dog got sick so we had to stay for an extended time in some Airbnbs to care for him. Ultimately he passed away in an monthly long airbnb stay a few weeks ago.   I cleaned the Airbnb before leaving putting things in the washing machine and dishwasher, etc as well. But I didn't feel it was as clean as it could be because honestly I just wanted to get out of there.  I offered the host to pay for a blanket we used to wrap him in when he passed away which was missing and also for some additional cleaning.   However the host went crazy listing tiny things such as the dishwasher drain was full of food, there was a food stain on the wooden floor, etc. They asked for around 550 USD compensation. Does this seem reasonable? I was expecting maybe 50$ for the blanket and 100$ for cleaning (Checkout cleaning fee was $10)."

Joel1530,26-09-2024 08:12 PM,"Dallas, TX","Hi,    I booked a stay at an AirBnB for a work conference. It was canceled by the sponsor 45 minutes after the cutoff for a partial refund. I immediately contacted the host to acknowledge that this was my problem, not his, but ask if I could cancel so it could be documented if I was successful getting my work to pay for the stay anyway. 

He said that he contacted AirBnB and they said no, that this was not possible. I'm not sure why AirBnB was involved, but I did not challenge him on this. I just said I would try to get vacation approved and come anyway. Unfortunately I was not successful and never checked in.    I understand losing all of the nightly rate, and AirBnB service charge. But it seems almost unethical that I have to pay for a cleaning fee that will have no reason to ever occur, nor be an expense to the host. In essence this just turns into an overage to the nightly rate and not reimbursing for a true cost. 

I don't see a way to challenge this part, and that is something that should be part of the AirBnB service and policy, not that I have to deal with individually with hosts. But I didn't find anything posted on AirBnB on the specific policy (that I believe would have to be relatively common) or how to contact AirBnB - other than opening a formal complaint (which I don't think is warranted as this should be a specific AirBnB policy). 

Am I missing something as far as specific documented policy or a way to discuss this casually with AirBnB support? This whole inability to have any form of customer support, along with generally what happened that was not the host's fault at all, certainly doesn't encourage me to use AirBnB again."

Your service fees and cleaning fees are getting ridiculous.  I just looked at one of the listings in Florida.  The cost is $1,400.00 for a one week rental.  And a total of $312 in fees on top of that.  Plus tax.  That's crazy!!!  It's in Brooksville!!!!   Not exactly a vacation hot spot.  These are used homes.  Not brand new Disney properties.  Most don't come pricy amenities, local or on-site eateries or security.  Most have four walls and a roof.  That's it!!!

These high fees are definitely not warranted.  I will definitely rethink spending the cash on rental home in the future.  I can find better value elsewhere...  "

Susan1404,29-12-2019 12:29 AM,"Covington, GA","I normally have guests that stay no longer than 6 nights and usually less than that.  However I just had my longest occupancy since joining Airbnb.  They arrived 12/1 and stayed until 12/21.  Although they were decent guests (2 people), they were pretty messy.  It didn't warrant a less than stellar, 5 star review, because they were very good guests in all other facets of their stay.  When they checked out, I did a brief walk-thru of the cabin and because it was daytime, I didn't turn on the lights.  As a result, I missed the fact that the kitchen counters were covered in sticky food substances, the floor needed to be not just be mopped, but actually needed scrubbing to remove a lot of smears, and the bathroom - suffice to say it needed extra scrubbing too.  I wish Airbnb had a way to charge varied cleaning fees contingent on the length of stay.  I wondered if anyone had a work-around that would allow me to charge something more appropriate for people staying longer than a week.  I typically charge a measly $15 cleaning fee, but that is just fine for short stays.  It was definitely not fine for this extended length of time. "

I visit bi-weekly to check up on my cleaners, check light fixtures, change filters, purchase supplies, make sure guest welcome book is in order, etc.  Do other hosts pay their cleaners to do these tasks? I've considered hiring someone to manage, but I have a hard time letting go.  I don't think a third party will have the attention to detail that I have.   I recently began employing a more detailed checklist for my cleaning service to use.  They've been checking off the items, but I'm certain that doesn't mean they've actually completed that task.

Debra300,01-12-2020 08:16 PM,"Gros Islet, Saint Lucia","I have a long-term guest who is staying with us while he's working in the area.  He initially booked for exactly 28 days, which had him checking out on a Tuesday.  Ten days ago he contacted me, because he wanted to extend his stay by a few days, but he said that the cleaning booking wouldn't allow him to submit the change.  I had chosen 48 hours buffer between each booking, and had to remove the buffer so he could submit his change.  I called Airbnb support, and inquired why was the system not allowing guests of an existing reservation to submit extension requests, because of cleaning buffers.  Of course, the rep is new, and didn't have a reasonable answer.  He responded, ""It's because you manually chose the buffer.""  I informed him that the buffers are systematically applied to the end of each reservation, and should recognize the difference between a new booking request (can't book during a buffer period) and extension of an existing reservation.  ""Well, I don't know."", is all the further explanation that I received.   Unfortunately, this use case can cause the loss of bookings.  Yesterday morning, my guest sent me another message saying that he will need to stay longer in the area, and wanted to extend for another month, but again he was being blocked by the cleaning buffer.  Within 20 minutes, and before I could respond to his message, another guest had a booked the space.  This worked fine for me (new booking is the same duration as the extension), but I felt really remorseful for our guest, because will have to look for another rental.  Other hosts may lose out in these types of situation, because the new reservation may not be as desirable as an extension of an existing reservation.     @Katie @Nick @Quincy @Liv @Lizzie, Would you please help with getting this item in front of the technical team?"

Lani20,09-03-2019 09:04 PM,"San Diego, CA","My friends and I have stayed at a few Airbnb’s over the past couple of months and I noticed all of them left cleaning instructions that they were expecting us to follow. They wanted us to wash our towels, take out trash, wash our dishes, strip the beds/pillows of sheets, etc. They all charged us a hefty cleaning fee, so I don’t understand why they expect us to do most of the cleaner’s job. I mean I definitely believe in respecting the units and keeping them tidy, but normal mess like laundry, trash, dishes should not be the guests responsibility.  We had to wake up extra early to ensure all those tasks were done on top of packing our things and getting ready to check out by 10 or 11am. And I’m sorry, but when you’re on vacation, having to wake up early and clean is very annoying. For that reason alone I will most likely not be using airbnb again. At hotels, they don’t require you to do anything. So why do we pay 200 dollar cleaning fees when we do a lot of the work?"

The wife took exception to us being in the property whilst they were here!  She was quite unpleasant.  she told me ""I didnt pay all this money to bunk up with strangers, this is not what AirBnB is about at all"". I explained this is exactly what AirBnB is and that is clear on out booking page that we live here.   As she was taking her luggage out of her car I saw that she had lots of party food (M&S pre-order buffet stuff , far more than enough for 6 people!!).  SHe told her husband to put all that back in the car and off they went into town to watch the match.  They got a taxi back around midnight, collected their luggage, and left in the taxi. Unfortunately they left a case in my kitchen so they had to return the next morning to collect that. Now, 3 weeks have passed, and they are asking for the £25 cleaning fee to be returned as they never stayed.   I'd be grateful for anyone's advice, please.   My personal thought are......   1.  I had to clean the house anyway.  2.  It was a rugby international weekend. Vacant rooms are almost impossible to find.  I could have filled those 3 rooms twice over with last minute requests! 3.  They were clearly going to have quite a few people over for a party. She told me they were meeting up with other family!! 4.

Michael8005,28-11-2023 03:29 PM,N/A,I had a guest whose husband sent me a message from a different Airbnb email/text  requesting the refund on their cleaning from their last stay. They claim they left the place in immaculate and gave me a good review so I should refund them their cleaning deposit. I told them no because I have to pay people to clean anyway and do the laundry and the floors so I'm sorry I can't.   But I was wondering if anybody else gets this request a lot and how they deal with it

Katherine1216,21-12-2024 06:39 PM,"Lansing, NY","I think it would make more sense to call it a one time turnover fee, that way, guests can see the advantage of staying more days to increase their nightly savings. By calling it a cleaning fee, I think guests do think they can leave a mess, failing to understand that the act of turning over the space (deeper cleaning, laundry and set up for the next guest) is difficult for shorter stays without a price bump."
GnG1,15-04-2025 06:00 PM,N/A,"Vacations are supposed to be relaxing, not stressful. But nothing drains your post-trip glow faster than a hefty and unexpected cleaning fee tacked onto your bill. Cleanliness isn’t just about tidiness—it’s about respect for the property and the next guest who’ll stay there. When you stay in a vacation rental, you're stepping into someone else’s space, and with that comes responsibility. Let’s talk about how to avoid cleaning fee mishaps and ensure your getaway remains free from drama.   What Are Cleaning Fees (and Why Are They Charged)? Cleaning fees might feel like a sneaky addition to your final bill, but they’re not random. They cover the cost of professional cleaning services to ensure the property is spotless, sanitized, and ready for the next wave of guests. Property owners rely on these fees to meet professional standards, ranging from laundered linens to sparkling countertops.   That said, cleaning fees aren’t a one-size-fits-all sort of thing. They vary depending on factors like the size of the property, its location, and the level of service provided. A cozy one-bedroom cabin may have a modest fee, while a sprawling beachfront mansion might come with a more eye-watering charge.   The key is to know what you're paying for and manage your expectations. No, guests are not usually expected to deep clean, but yes, there’s an unspoken agreement to leave the property in reasonable condition. The clearer you are on what the fee covers, the less likely you’ll run into surprises.   Be Prepared: Do Your Homework Before Booking The easiest way to avoid cleaning fee confusion? Research the property before clicking “Book Now.” Start where it matters: the listing. Property descriptions usually include line items like cleaning fees and house rules. Read that fine print carefully. If there’s wording like “Additional charges for excessive messes,” note it—it could save you a financial headache later.   Guest reviews are another goldmine of information. Look for mentions of cleanliness, particularly in how property managers enforce cleaning policies. Other guests’ experiences can offer clues about what’s expected.   Still unsure? Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Reaching out to the property manager is not only acceptable—it’s smart. Ask specific questions to clarify what the cleaning fee covers and what’s expected of you at checkout. Clear communication now prevents miscommunication later.   Staying Clean During Your Stay Once you’ve arrived, it’s all about developing simple routines to keep the space tidy. You don’t need to scrub floors or vacuum daily, but small habits go a long way in avoiding cleaning fee debacles. Tidy as You Go: Wash dishes after meals, wipe down surfaces, and put things back in place. Staying ahead of messes means less stress come checkout time.   Be Trash-Savvy: Know where trash and recycling bins are, and use them often. Don’t let garbage pile up or leave it scattered.   Spills Happen—Clean Them Immediately: If you spill coffee on the rug or drop pasta sauce on the counter, address it right away. It minimizes stains or damage, often sparing you an extra charge. If you're traveling with kids or pets, extra vigilance helps. Accidents are inevitable, but how you handle them can make or break post-stay disputes.   Wrapping Up: The Art of a Smooth Checkout Checking out isn’t just about locking up and leaving—it’s about leaving the property in a state that acknowledges the next guest. Most vacation rentals provide a checkout checklist: Stick to it. Common tasks include loading the dishwasher, gathering used towels, and ensuring trash is thrown out. While rarely required, stripping the bed or starting a load of laundry is also a nice touch (and may even earn you kudos from the host).   If the property manager hasn’t provided detailed checkout instructions, focus on the basics. Leave the space reasonably clean—like you would if a friend were visiting, not a cleaning crew.   Before you leave, take a few minutes to walk through the property. Snap photos of each room to document its condition. This protects you in case disputes arise about damage or cleanliness. If something broke during your stay or you noticed a problem, report it to the property manager proactively. Honesty and transparency go a long way toward resolving issues amicably.   Communication: A Key to Staying in the Clear Good communication with your property manager is like a safety net—it can catch issues before they spiral out of control. Ask questions, clarify policies, and let them know if something unexpected goes wrong. A little courtesy goes a long way in keeping the relationship friendly and fee-free.   Remember, property managers are people too. They appreciate guests who show consideration for their efforts to maintain the property. By fostering a polite and open relationship, you’re not just avoiding cleaning fees—you’re also helping lay the groundwork for a positive experience for all parties involved.   Final Thoughts Cleanliness isn't just a property manager’s responsibility—it’s a shared one. By managing messes during your stay, researching policies ahead of time, and following reasonable checkout practices, you can avoid cleaning fee horror stories altogether. Plus, you’ll leave behind a space that’s ready to welcome the next happy guest.   If you’ve had a great experience (or a hard-learned lesson) about vacation rental etiquette, consider sharing it in the comments below. Your insight could be the encouragement someone else needs to embrace this shared sense of responsibility—and make the world of vacation rentals cleaner and kinder for everyone.   By taking the time to understand cleaning fees and practicing thoughtful habits during your stay, you’ll not only avoid unexpected charges—you’ll elevate the entire vacation rental experience. And isn’t that what a getaway is all about?   Happy travels!"

Ari49608,27-05-2023 03:19 PM,N/A,"Hi,   I'm in a bit of a pickle and need some advice. I've had a sweet streak of about 150 nights with no issues. Now, I've got a guest who's padding around my main floor in white socks and they're coming up dirty. Yep, didn't see that coming!   So here's the lowdown. A guest checked into my property and raised a concern about the cleanliness of the floors. I checked with my cleaners who swear they did the job. They even went back for round two at my request to reckless the floors.   Throw into the mix the recent hazy conditions due to Canadian wildfires over here in Denver, likely stirring up more dirt and particles than usual, and mentioned to the guest but didn’t get an acknowledgment.   A couple of hours later, I get a sock-selfie from the guest (pic below), still unhappy and not too keen on paying the cleaning fee. You can imagine my face.   So, I’m all ears. What do you guys think? Is the guest just trying to wiggle out of the cleaning fee? Should I bite the bullet and let the fee slide to avoid a scathing review? Maybe knock off $50 from the $230 fee? Or should I get the cleaners back in for a hat trick, even though it might not mean squeaky-clean socks for the guest?    "

Patrick3629,27-04-2025 04:33 AM,N/A,"Hi there fellow Airbnb hosts. I am hoping that you can help me with a difficult situation. Thanks in advance for your expert suggestions.   We are superhosts of a 8-person holiday home in Australia and have a rating of 4.92 from about 160 reviews. Unfortunately, our last guests left our holiday home in a shockingly dirty state, with rubbish and food rests everywhere. They also left persistent stains on the kitchen benchtop.   Our cleaners had to spend an extra two hours cleaning the place, which has created a significant extra expense, further potentiated by public holiday cleaning rates ($240). I would like to charge our guests this amount, but don't know how to best manage it, without creating more issues, especially if they were to turn against us and give us a bad rating.   The other thing I would like to do, is to provide an honest guest rating, so that other Airbnb hosts know who and what they will be dealing with. Interestingly, the guests had previously stayed in two other Airbnb properties, but had no reviews at all. I could of course just walk away, wear the extra cost and not welcome them back again, but I believe I owe it to them and the Airbnb community to provide honest feedback.   I would appreciate any suggestions on how you best manage this situation.   Regards, Patrick"

Robin4,29-12-2019 10:54 PM,"Mount Barker, Australia","While I do not justify exorbitant cleaning fees, I have come to the realisation through, not just being here on the Airbnb CC but, on other sites I am active with, many guests are unhappy with having to pay a 'cleaning fee' and don't realise why they have to!   I host through Airbnb and I have a $15 per guest stay cleaning fee. As you all know that is not a per night fee it is a once only fee for the duration of the stay. I would say to many guests 'Would you consider that ridiculously high?' But some guests consider that even that fee should not be charged! The second thing is, there is a difference, hosts don’t expect guests to clean the property, they just don’t want the guest to walk out and leave it like a pig-sty! No host expects a guest to prepare for the next reservation to arrive.   We don’t expect you to wipe down the walls, the counter-tops, attend to those coffee cup rings on the bedside and occasional tables, checking for insects and spider webs. We don’t expect you to strip the bed and remove those blood, alcohol or makeup stains from the linens, put them through the washing machine, dry them and iron ready for a future guest. We don’t expect you to wash the towels and provide new face-washers to replace those that were destroyed by nail polish remover, acne treatment cream and fake tan lotion. We don’t expect you to remake the bed with fresh linens and put out a new set of towels and face washers. We don’t expect you to vacuum the carpets, rugs and steam mop the floors. We don’t expect you to clean the toilet, shower alcove, sinks and taps. We don’t expect that you will wash, dry and put away the dishes, cutlery, saucepans and glassware that you have used. We don’t expect you to restock the fridge with a cheese plate, milk, eggs and bacon, fruit juice, a beer and a cider and water from the re-stock facilities. We don’t expect you to test that the TV, the fridge, the hot water, the DVD player, the air conditioning filter, the washing machine, the smoke alarm, the microwave and hotplate, the electric blankets are all working! This is what we charge a cleaning fee for! To return the property to the state which the guest enters it in. We just expect you will put your rubbish in the bin, pick up those used nappies and condoms that were left under the bed and dispose of. Put furniture back the way you found it. Leave the property in a relatively tidy state. That’s all we expect!   There are certain overheads that must be covered in order to provide a listing in the first place. There is a property mortgage to be covered, insurances, council rates and permits, maintenance, breakages, gardening, electricity and gas, water the constant supply of condiments……..This is what you pay for in the listing amount. It is most unfortunate that many guests do not seem to be able to differentiate between the two!! The listing amount covers the cost of supplying the property. The cleaning fee covers the cost of continuing to offer it to guests!   Cheers…..Rob"

They assured me they would refund any unused cleans, long story short they haven't refunded anything and Abbey the Operations Manger who promised the refund has ignored me ever since. They owe me £405. She sent me a message to say it was being processed (untrue). I am now instigating legal action & will be notifying the police/trading standards etc  I will be fair and say that they did initially offer a good service but as soon as you ask for the promised refund, you will hit a wall.

I dont know what people are paying across the country but I am paying $100 to clean a 2 bedroom house and $150 to clean a 3 bedroom house. And now she wants more because she found out that other people are charging more. I had to raise my minimum days to 3 because of what I have to pay to clean the house.  Even with the 3 day stay I am barely making more than her by the time fees and taxes are taken. And what gets me is since its a BnB its getting cleaned every 3-4 days and 99 out a 100 guest leave the house pretty clean so it takes less than 2 hours to clean. Thats $50 an hour shes making to clean house. I dont mean to take anything away from house cleaners but C'mon $50 an hour. It doesnt take any special skills, anybody can clean a house and almost everybody has cleaned a house at some time in their life, its not hard work or takes a lot of brain power yet I am paying them more than my doctor, they make more than cops and firefighters who risk their lives every day and they make a lot more than our servicemen and women who fight for our freedom.  And now she wants more,  unbelievable.  How many people makes $50 an hour, I know I sure dont  And whats worse is all the cleaning companies are this way, I actually was told by one company that they charge $80 an to do laundry, $80 an hour to throw a load of laundry in a washer, (takes 60 seconds)come back in a half hour and throw them in a dryer(takes 30 seconds) then come back in an hour and fold them (takes maybe 10 minutes) and apparently there are host who pay that. There comes a point where you have to say enough and I have reached that point. So not only am I going to refuse paying her more I am going to stop using her altogether.

I am thinking about using iCal and sending her the schedule . May also write the cleaning tile windows  on a paper calendar. How do you communicate with your cleaner? How do you make sure cleaner  has been there and cleaned if you are remote? I have a local friend who will come to inspect. I am thinking about putting in a Schlage Yale lock so I can check who has been in and out remotely.

Sam397,14-05-2021 08:13 PM,"Reno, NV",I am sure this topic has come up several times but I am curios' as to how many host charge cleaning fees. I didnt when I first started hosting but with all the extra cleaning we have to do because of the virus I started charging a one time fee of $50.  That doesnt cover the cost to get it cleaned but I am worried if I charge more people wont book. So I was wandering what other host are doing and if they do charge a fee how did they come up with what to charge. Also is it better to charge a 1 time fee or to add on to your daily rates. Thanks. 
Olga6,08-01-2025 03:33 PM,"London, United Kingdom","I removed cleaning fee as it makes daily price too high since now it is added on map search. Even if place is available on 3 nights minimum it is added on a day rate. So wrong! It is virtually forcing hosts to scrap cleaning fee.  For my flat in London cleaning between guests + laundry service goes to a minimum of £120.  This doesn't include things like upholstery cleaning, carpet cleaning, windows cleaning. Just basic, if guests are not too messy.  For bookings over 1 week we provide FREE of charge once a week basic cleaning and change of laundry.  This amounts to £80-£100 per week extra or even if the booking is just 8-9 days. There is no way on the platform that this can be advertised as a perk that comes with the flat.  Further, Airbnb is offering option to forgo cleaning fee for short stays. This makes no sense as the place needs proper cleaning even if guests stays only one night! Are we to recycle used sheets and towels!? If anything, it should be reversed, discounting cleaning fee for long stays.  My place is on minimum 3 days but I recently accepted booking for just two nights: nightmare! Not only that red wine is poured over white upholstery but the smell of the place is beyond believable! We can not get rid of it still, 10 days after check out.  Anyone struggles with same issues? Any advise is welcome.  Olga London  "

While being understanding that a spare roll should have been provided and profusely apologizing and offering to compensate them for their inconvenience of running 5 minutes down the road and purchasing a roll, I don't think a full refund of the $99 cleaning fee is appropriate.

The porch was blown off leaves and the exterior blown but due to being in a wooded area near lake it’s hard to manage. This was done few days prior AND day before.    House remodeled for about two years, freshly painted. MOSTLY new furniture, couch new, mattresses new, sheets new, towels new.    No animals or people have stayed in two years. No musty smell. Air fresheners but it’s very light.  -The guests said the house smelled like animals. When they were told there no animals they said it’s a musty smell.   -pubic hair bunched around shower. Guess what? Shower NEVER used. Plus I’m Asian and and even if I did shower that’s not how Asian hair looks like.   -piece of dust on kitchen cabinet. She called this cobwebs. First cobwebs don’t grow there like that. They grow in corners. House was last cleaned-day before. It’s clear someone put it there-not even a “smear” where you’re wiping something.   -long red piece of lint/yarn on carpet. I don’t own anything red.  Guest saying they have to vacuum now.   -all this dirt on the floor. I don’t know where that dirt came from. And it has seeds in it that aren’t indigenous to our wooded area.    Guest is suggesting they have to vacuum and mop floors. I think goal is to scam cleaning fee.    Anyone else have that issue?    Lynn . "

Laura2592,12-09-2019 10:59 PM,"Frederick, MD","I had posted that I learned a lot about cleaning having an Airbnb. I hate cleaning and have a cleaning service in my primary residence. It was clear after a few rounds with them at our Airbnb we needed to be working on some of the cleaning ourselves in addition to having a cleaner come in. We collect a lot of feedback from our guests via a suggestion box. One of the biggest challenges is meeting what I call the ""personal cleanliness expectation"" or PCE.  PCE consists of general big ticket items like clean floors and counters, non-sticky tables,  no dust bunnies, scrubbed toilets, etc. But each guest has there own individual ""PCE"" items-- if they see one, doesn't matter for some how nice the big ticket things are. You lose a point or more as they signal ""not clean enough"" to the guest.    Now some of these PCEs are over the top, so bear with me. But this is what I have discovered. I am sure a lot of other hosts will chime in (at least I hope so.)   First, bugs. Our cottage is on a big rural wooded lot. So bugs get inside. Spiders when its cold, flies and mosquitoes (and fireflies!) sometimes when its warm. Crickets any time. We have a big porch and a little vestibule between the screen and main front door. Crickets especially will wait and hop in when the lights are on. Some guests will say that the place isn't clean if they see a bug, alive or dead. This is something we work very hard to manage, but nature is gonna be nature out in the country under the trees.    Anything that is supposed to look distressed. We have a very rustic reclaimed floor in one of our bathroom made of old barn wood. Personally I love it. Its got old paint and goes well with the vibe of the house. It gets mopped and cleaned with all other floor surfaces. But one guest said it looked ""old and dirty."" Likewise the bedside tables in one bedroom are chalk painted and shabby chic. One guest left a comment that they weren't ""crisp and new"" looking (they aren't, nor are they supposed to be). If you look at all the fancy ""luxe"" places on Airbnb they have a very specific type of look-- white, open, clean edges, new-appearing. So be careful if your place invites a different aesthetic.   Baseboards and picture frames. Yes its common sense to dust them. But one guest told us that she does the ""white glove test"" on those areas before giving out 5 stars.  (Good to know.)   Dark furniture. Some guests see dark, heavy furniture as ""dirty"" even when its not. Grays, beiges and bright colors seem not to evoke this reaction. Same with dark counters. Why? No clue.    Areas behind shelves/washer dryer/pieces of furniture. I know-- who goes behind that stuff? Guests do, especially if they have small kids or pets with toys. We were appalled to discover that the area behind the washer and dryer in our laundry room was super gross. It took some effort to move the machines and clean but now we have a long swiffer type duster thing that helps.   Your personal stuff. We had a drawer in a piece of furniture in the bathroom where we left a tube of our almost brand new toothpaste by accident. Guests found it and were unhappy... it seemed like we should have cleaned better.    Stoves and fridges. Yes, they should be clean. They should be very very clean all the time. If your place is spotless otherwise, but certain guests open a stove or fridge and sees any evidence of muck,  your place is not clean enough to meet their PCE.  Same goes with a microwave.   Smells. We have a solid stone built cottage with 18"" thick walls (about 45 cm). We can't vent to outside for a fan without paying an exorbitant amount. We can't fit a recirculating fan under the hand built hickory cabinets because they aren't a standard size. So we don't have a toaster or allow deep frying. Why? The smells. We found out the hard way that some cooking smells (really burnt toast is the worst!) really linger in a place with 18 inch thick stone walls and only ceiling fans to help move odors along. If your place does not smell fresh right upon opening the door, its not meeting someone's PCE. This is particularly true in a place that allows pets as not all of your guests have them and no one wants to smell someone else's wet dog.    Please feel free to add what you have found!                  "

Huma0,08-08-2018 11:50 PM,"London, United Kingdom","I'm wondering if anyone can help with this.   I recently had a new bathroom installed with gold plated fittings (shower, taps etc.). You are not supposed to use standard cleaning products on these as they can damage and strip the gold finish. Instead, you use diluted dishsoap/washing up liquid and you can also buff with a soft dry cloth. I have tried this, my cleaner has tried it, and it does't work.   Almost from day one, the shower valves especially were covered in watermarks that won't come off and make them look dirty. I have exactly the same style of shower in another bathroom in chrome, which is years old but never has this problem because it's cleaned with normal bathroom cleaners.   I called the manufacter to ask what they would recommend and they said either the diluted dishsoap or diluted white wine vinegar. So, I tried the latter as well. Didn't make any difference. I bought a gold polishing cloth (the kind you use on jewellery). That didn't work. Neither did a microfibre cloth for cleaning chrome.   I've heard suggestions to use Brasso or Silvo but the manufacturer said absolutely NOT to use that. In fact, they wouldn't recommend anything other than washing up liquid or dilued vinegar. A lot of the suggestions I've found online are for removing tarnish from gold and that's not the problem.   Any suggestions that have been tried and tested? This is the fitting that's showing the water marks the worst and how it looked when new and unused. It does not look like that now!   "

Jillie1,09-07-2020 12:51 PM,"Harrogate, United Kingdom","After reading the new enhanced cleaning protocol and subsequently passing the quiz, I have since read the more in depth version and decided that taking down and cleaning my 3 sets of very heavy 10 ft long curtains for cleaning & sanitising will be too much.  Similarly, with the re-washing of already clean and put away crockery, cutlery, glasses, pots & pans etc in the kitchen.  (I always previously did a check to see everything which was put away in the cupboards was clean and any pots and pans which were not up to standard, I of course re-washed) but to re-wash everything clean in the cupboards is ridiculous!   For this reason,  as far as the enhanced cleaning protocol,   ""I'M OUT"" as they would say in Dragon's Den and will be taking down my badge shortly to replace it with the 72 hour one!     I have 5 star cleaning reviews which I intend to maintain, de-cluttered the space - removing books, games & various other things and will allow several days before and after bookings.  I will also use masks, gloves etc and follow all the simplified cleaning protocol rules and provide cleaning materials and sanitisers for my guests.

Janene10,11-12-2020 11:32 PM,"Mudgee, Australia","Hi Everyone.   I have been hosting a cottage on a country property for about 18 months. The cottage is not a 5 star luxury place and the nightly price point matches this. It is just a lovely cottage on a large property with dirt roads and starry skies.  I am seeing a pattern emerging with reviews and stars that I feel I need help with.   It involves the cleaning reviews.   Most of my guests LOVE their stay and give me amazing reviews. I have attained Superhost status.   However, I see something eroding my score. Which started with one guest, giving me really a low score.   I had one guest who was obviously had some OCD tendency. He actually lifted up the rug under a heavy wrought iron bed and showed me the dirt under there. He sent pictures of tile glue and claimed it was dirt, he put paper on the floor and sent a pic of his dirty boot mark on it, he claimed the bench tops were unclean but they are oiled wooden benchtops that have a certain feel... and all through his stay he was texting and texting to the point  I didn't know what to do. He gave a long very critical review about the cleanliness and my communication and scored me really low which really hit my rating. It was so odd, it made me wonder if a competing bnb had sent him deliberately to give me a bad review (it made me that paranoid it was so bizarre!)   I have never had to deal with anyone like him since, however, since looking more closely at my ratings, I have found, those guests who have not followed the house rules precisely have scored me low , example; because it is an out of town country property one of the rules is that guests take their rubbish with them to dispose of at the community mini bins on the road out of the area - so guests who have not done that and left their rubbish, end up scoring me low on cleaning, as though trying to counteract their own actions? I don't get it.   I have a cleaner, I also go and clean the morning of arrival, there is no way there is uncleanliness in my cottage.   However, I see my score getting lower because of this and its really frustrating me.   Even for guests who have left their rubbish, I never score them badly on their reviews.   It is just really concerning me now, especially with covid, unfair cleaning reviews like this could really put guests off wanting to stay.    I don't know what to do? Appreciate all advice."

(We allow dogs in the apartment, and it is an older home, cleaning it is tricky. I try really hard to make this known, but we seem to have disapointed customers frequently).    I am looking at professional cleaning services because obviously I need some help and I cannot find anything that charges less than $150.00 to change the sheets and clean the one bedroom apartment. Typically I rent the apartment for $65 a night, so you can see why this seems steap to me.    Are there services out there that offer cleaning services for less on these types of properties. I imagine it is easier to clean an Airbnb than a typical home so it seems that the price ought to reflect that. "

Jeannet121,05-04-2021 11:33 PM,"Cambridge, United Kingdom","Hi Everyone,    I have been hosting through Airbnb since 2013 and have been a super host for several years now. I live in a studio in the garden and share amenities in the house, where I make three rooms available for (mostly long-term) guests - visiting scholars, interns, etc.   When the advisory Covid cleaning protocol was introduced, I consulted with my long-term guests, and we all agreed we did not want to live like that (i.e. wearing masks) in our own home. When the cleaning protocol was made mandatory I phoned Airbnb and explained that although I complied with the national and local laws and guidelines around Covid, I could not commit to the requirements of the 36 page cleaning booklet. I asked if I should cancel my bookings, and they suggested I wait and see what happens.   Whenever anyone expressed an interest in coming to stay I was upfront with them and explained that although we were being careful and compliant with national and local guidelines around Covid, I was not adhering to the Airbnb cleaning protocol. By far most people agreed this was acceptable to them.    Nothing did, in fact, happen until last week, when I received an email to say my calendar had been blocked as I was non-compliant with the cleaning protocol. I phoned Airbnb, explained my situation and informed them that sadly we would have to part ways. They explained the requirements were to 'keep me safe', but I am vaccinated and work outside the home in any case (so a degree of risk is part of my life), and my guests tend to come for longer stays (1 month or more - often several months at a time), so we are all part of a household bubble.    I seems to me that this requirement is taking Airbnb away from the original concept of welcoming guests into you home informally as part of your household, and that these requirements makes it more into a business / more like a hotel. I wonder whether we will see a shift in those hosting away from hosts in the original sense to people who are commercially renting self-contained units or houses in multiple occupation through Airbnb. The policy feels very paternalistic to me, and I wonder if it is insurance driven ...    I was about to retire on the basis of supplementing my income through Airbnb rentals (already more precarious due to Covid travel restrictions) and will have to reconsider. I am now trying to rebuild my business through other platforms.    I wanted to ask how many of you are in a similar position - losing a business built up over years due to the Airbnb requirements which are way over and above the national and local rules and regulations.   How are you responding to this? I wonder if Airbnb will lose many hosts, or whether in the face of an impossible dilemma, there will be those who say they are complying with the protocol, when, in fact, they are not.    I would love to hear your thoughts and solutions (if there are any!).    With all my best, Jeannet in Cambridge"

I host 1 room in my house and I make no restrictions to the guests and openly say they can use anything they need in the kitchen as this is self catering after all so I want people to be able to cook and not feel like they have to go out.   I do also supply a continental breakfast with the room (cereal, fruit, porridge pots) which just goes in a box that they can take up to their room to have at their leisure.   NOW: Is it unreasonable to think people would wash their pots and pans after use and their plates/bowls? To me, its a self catering apartment, I would ALWAYS do this.   I have had 30 guests this year and only 1 has done their own dishes, everyone else just left it all around the house where they ate?    (PS.

Namita9,11-07-2022 09:02 PM,"Grand Prairie, TX","I had an agreement with a cleaning company and the contract clearly states that either party needs to give 30 day notice by mail for termination. Recently, the cleaning company was not performing a quality job. This led to a 2 star review by a guest because of dirty floor and other negative reviews when it came to cleanliness in my listing. When I addressed this issue to the manager of the cleaning company, he gaslighted me and said that it was because I did not do deep cleaning, which would cost more money than what I charge the guests. However, the dirty floor was part of basic cleaning. The manager argued with me over the phone and hung up on me saying that he wants to terminate the contract effective immediately. He cancelled the next day and future cleanings immediately. He had been making excuses to drop my listing as he had been receiving more clients which would fetch him additional revenue such as deep cleaning, additional laundry, etc.    As there is a violation of the contract here (he did not provide me with a 30 day notice) and also did not provide a quality service for the amount charged, I do not want to let this slide. I have also experienced tremendous stress because of this situation. Has anybody experienced this situation?"
Patricia55,16-05-2019 05:48 PM,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","I read on a thread recently – sorry, can't remember where – about some guest saying that if they were paying a cleaning fee that meant they didn't have to lift a finger... Whut?! OK, full disclosure: cleaning isn't my forte or my joy! But since we started hosting we realised we'd have to raise our standards, given that we're sharing our home with others. I figure the same applies to guests. To my mind, someone using the cleaning fee as an excuse for not doing ANY house-keeping is probably a lazy slob. I reckon there's slow muck and quick muck; I WOULD'NT expect a (short term) guest to do any dusting, vacuuming, shower-cleaning, (window-cleaning!) etc. I WOULD expect any guest to clean up after any sudden, accidental spillages... (or at least let me know so I could help!).. cos, otherwise they're just wallowing in their own filth, if they're staying for any length of time!! Jeebus, it's just common sense."

Robin4,30-06-2022 05:02 AM,"Mount Barker, Australia","Sorry long post but in an endeavour to create less friction between guest and host, I think it is an important read.   Here we go again, every few days this cleaning fee thing drops back in here for another airing. By the frequency of posts here there seems to be an ever increasing pool of guests complaining about, not just having to pay a cleaning fee but, having to clean as well. It seems to them that Airbnb and their hosts are double dipping! Perhaps it's time we rationalized the cleaning fee from not just the guests perspective but the hosts as well.   To Airbnb's credit they have now dropped the 'cheapest cab at the rank' method of displaying listing prices, but it is the breakdown of extras on top of the base price that seems to be causing a lot of friction amongst guests. Some of these extras like, an additional amount per person, guests will accept because they do understand that extra bodies mean extra facilities with extra work, and seasonal extra pricing for in demand situations. But a cleaning fee is seen as this nebulous thing that varies vastly from listing to listing, the guest still is required 'to clean' and many of them feel it has no right to be there.   So, as hosts....... We need to be realistic with the cleaning fee we set. We have to strike a balance that can be justified from both sides.  I understand that many city professional cleaning companies will charge $40 per hour pr cleaner and the average 3 bedroom apartment is going to take 2.5 hours to properly clean with 2 personnel. For the average apartment that amounts to a cleaning cost of $200 per turnaround which most guests are going to find difficult to accept.......and when you expect a certain amount of pre-cleaning on the guests part, they are going to be outright hostile!   But why accept a company cleaning fee of $200 per clean? There are many citizens out there in almost every community who will jump at the opportunity to take on a cleaning role for $60 per turnaround.......... I do and my cleaner charges me $30 per turnaround! She does 2-3 per week, is a real cleanaholic and just loves that additional $60-$90 pr/wk that this puts in her pocket that she would not have otherwise had.    It is not hard to track down this cleaning help, I have done it for 2 other hosts in my area and it works wonderfully. If a host raises their hosting amount by $15 pr night and sets a cleaning fee of $40 and has 2 guests per week they are break even, get 3 guests per week and they are ahead and the guest will accept that gladly because they will see it as a reasonable charge and will be quite prepared to chuck the linens in the washer, put their rubbish out.   Personally I ask guest to do nothing, just walk out and leave the cleaning to us because, I know if the guest does it, it won't be done properly! The glasses and dishes will get a quick rinse over and put back in the cupboard with bits of food on the frypan and plates, lipstick smears on the glasses, all set for the next guest to give me a 'raspberry' for cleanliness! Bed linens will be put into the wash with blood and makeup stains which makes them even harder to remove. I don't want them putting there rubbish out because they won't recycle, they will just stick it all in one bag and stuff it in the nearest available bin! I don't want to have to second guess what guests have or haven't done, I just want them to gather up their bags and leave the rest to us!   So from the hosts point of view: Don't be some cleaning company's cash cow, seek out economical cleaning options.....they are available and they work well. Don't expect your guests to do your work, it's up to the host to provide that clean and properly serviced listing.   Now as guests...... STR hosts are not hotel chains, they are not offering many stay options under the one roof where fixed and servicing costs can be spread across possibly hundreds of paying rooms. They are offering an individual experience and it's up to the guest to realise there is a distinction between providing that individual service, and maintaining it.     To maintain the service......."

Netta5,26-07-2020 11:47 AM,Israel,"I'm using Airbnb nonstop and I love it. Recently I encounter an uncomfortable experience and I would like to hear your opinion please. Just to note, it's Airbnb plus and I assumed it should be better, but I was wrong. Unfortunately, I booked this place for one month so I can't leave   I arrived at the Airbnb, there were some dysfunctions, I took pictures of them but I thought that I can handle with them, just for the worst-case scenario, and told the host about some of them. On the first night, I planned to use the dishwasher after I cooked and I noticed that the door cannot be closed because there's an accumulation of calcium beneath (I guess because of the time of the quarantine there were no guests here). In the morning after I send a message to the host, he responded after 6 hours that he'll invite a repairman for the day after that will come between 10:00-14:00.    I was uncomfortable with that because the host itself told me he didn't come to welcome me because of the COVID-9 issues, and anyway all the time he sent his friend to check things because he's not in the city (So he lied apparently). On the day after I ruined my plans for the morning and I was waiting. At 13:00 while I was waiting he wrote to me that the repairman canceled so he wants to invite him for the day after in the afternoon (also with a time-frame of 4 hours). He told me that I don't have to be in the apartment but I told him that I don't feel comfortable with that because I want to make sure that his friend and the repairman are using masks and also there's no place here to lock my stuff so I'm a bit concern.  Anyway, the host wasn't nice at all, he all the time repeated that it's not his fault and when he sent me the message at 13:00 he wrote me ""at least you were waiting only 3 hours, and not 4"" like he has no respect to my time at all. All the time I tried to contact Airbnb and they replayed after 2 days and were not responsive and feel like they don't care at all. But I wanted to have a dishwasher so I wanted to give it another chance maybe, but then I realized that there is not even one cleaning material in the apartment and thought that of course there's a chance that the repairman or his friend would like to use the toilet and it won't be humane not to let them. So I asked the ""Plus"" host and he told me that ""honestly"" he gave me a monthly discount so he doesn't think he should provide me any cleaning materials. I tried to explain to him that it's also for his good to maintain the apartment but he refused. Besides, he sent me a message and wrote that he thinks that it was a ""mystery"" what happened to the dishwasher because the cleaning team told him they cleaned it but luckily I had a pic I took 1.5 hours after I arrived showed clearly that the door of the dishwasher is open and that there's an accumulation of salt beneath.    In all my last Airbnbs there were cleaning materials even if it was not written in the amenities. I was surprised that he refused to provide me and more surprised that Airbnb told me that he shouldn't provide me because it wasn't written in the amenities. I saw articles of Airbnb where they wrote clearly that the host should provide cleaning materials because of the COVID-9 situation.   In the meanwhile, I wash the dishes by hand and count my days until check out I'm doing all I can to be a polite & clean guest, the only reason I want cleaning materials is that I care for the place I stay in and I want to keep it nice & clean.   I'm very disappointed with Airbnb that they don't try to help to find another place. The behavior of the host makes me feel uncomfortable staying here. I understand that people can have financial problems but I don't think that I ask something that isn't basic. I really want to leave   Thanks, Netta"

Margaret1115,14-01-2022 07:49 PM,"San Diego, CA","Hello there, My husband and I purchased a nice little cabin in Big Bear Lake in Moonridge last year and decided to start renting it out. Its a small 3 bedroom 1 bath cabin with a front and back deck. It has been quite the learning process and we've really enjoyed it but we have never been completely satisfied with our cleaning company. Finding a reliable company in Big Bear was our biggest challenge and we appreciated them taking us on as clients. But since the beginning it seems our place is always last, they go well past check-in time and the guest arrives in the middle of their cleaning, but mostly our guests always find things that aren't quite clean or things a previous guest left behind. Since taking them on we have had to credit multiple guests and live in fear of bad reviews. We manage our single property ourselves and having reliable cleaners would just be a great weight lifted off our shoulders. The one caveat is that we were unable to put a washer/dryer for laundry in our cabin, and it was exceedingly difficult to find a company that offered off-site laundry. Does anyone have any recommendations or honestly, advice or previous experience with an issue like this? We would appreciate it. "

Jennifer3225,14-09-2023 03:54 PM,"Port Severn, Canada","Jennifer: I have observed an increasing number of companies that are inventing smaller packaging solutions to produce cleaning products. Nowadays, I can see tablets that can be placed in containers with instructions to add just the right amount of water. This usually helps decrease the storage space required in our listings and cupboards of cleaning supplies.

If I expect or want to support my guests to keep the listing clean, I make sure that the products provided are readily available (but still out of reach of children).

A few other things I ensure are :  This change doesn't happen overnight, it takes a lot of conscious effort from my side. I don’t usually throw out the items but rather be fiscally smart and when a refill is needed, look for solutions with a sustainable lens with less packaging.       Felicity: We all want to be clean, but we also know that there are many cleaning products that have chemicals in them that are not good for us and, in some cases, may have serious impacts on our health. I’ve noticed that In many cases it is possible to find natural cleaning products that do a great job at cleaning. Such products do not have harmful chemicals or toxins that can mix into our water system.    There are now wide ranges of refillable cleaning products, available in many refill stores. I usually minimize waste by avoiding buying new containers and using refill pouches. Some stores will offer a ‘refill on the spot’ option or a ‘container swap program’. I’ve seen that concentrated products cut down on transport emissions and packaging.

Hugo144,01-12-2017 05:55 PM,"Maldonado, Uruguay","Hi everybody! I am from Uruguay, Punta del Este, I am new to this business and I want to start hosting (I am currently working on getting my listing ready). It is a small private bedroom with a tiny hallway and a bathroom. My question is how often should I clean the place, since -from what I've read in Airbnb- the topics always seem to be cleaning before one guest arrives and after one guest leaves, and it seems sort of unusual to clean the place during the guests stay. Shouldn't cleaning be done once a day, like in hotels? Do you have to lay beds or do you leave it to the guests? Especially for the bathroom, should I allow days before cleaning it?  I'd appreciate your comments and I'd very much like to learn from your experiences. Thank you, dear community!"

Danny21,09-04-2018 10:26 AM,"Manchester, United Kingdom","Firstly, this is definitely NOT a reflection on my practices.   I recently read an article on a legitimate news website titled 'What Hotels Don't Want You To Know'. It had some shocking entries and some which made me pause for thought.   One in particular was 'Hotels don't use clean linens unless you ask for it'. Which got me thinking.   Pros: 1. This would certainly cut down the turn-around time tremendously as only evidentally dirty linens/towels would need to be laundered and not the whole lot. 2. By not laundering linens after every guest, this would cut down on laundering costs (at-home or hired). 3. It would cut down on electricity consumption which has a number of other benefits (reduced bills, reduced environmental impact)   Cons: 1. What if a guest has an STI, crabs or lice and the linen gets infected. What would happen if a guest complains? How would this differ from a hotel? 2. Evidentally dirty linens were to be washed but not some, what if the guest complains of 'funny smells' e.g perfume/make-up? (you wouldn't notice the make-up if it was the same/similar colour to the bed sheets)   Anyone any thoughts on the matter please?

Pat280,17-01-2019 10:11 PM,"Auckland, New Zealand",I recently hired an Air BnB last week for an event (surprise birthday for my partner) which was approved by the Host. Once I told her about an event she then asked how many people and I told her it would only be 30-40 as it’s a small birthday nothing big. She then proceeded to pay an extra cleaning fee of $400 on top of the $150 cleaning fee already charged.    After we left (no damages) we put all the rubbish into rubbish bags and plastic bags and put it one place by in the backyard as all the bins were overly full. Today she messages saying she will report me for leaving my rubbish behind! This makes no sense as we had paid an excessive cleaning fee for God knows what! I don’t want to have this affect me as I’ve been using Air BnB for 3 years and use it frequently and have a good rep. What can I do about this? Can I challenge a review?

She will also be doing a small load of laundry. The camp is located in Indian Lake, NY. I checked through a service like Angie's List just to get some ideas and they would charge me $86 to clean on a weekly basis, not including laundry. Does this sound reasonable? Do most cleaners charge per hour? I'm guessing some jobs will be easier than others, so it might make sense to offer to pay per hour versus a flat fee? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Krystal16,07-02-2020 05:16 PM,"Toronto, Canada","I am interested to know what most hosts are paying for their cleaning services, what those services include, and the size of their units.  I am opening a second Airbnb and my original cleaner can not take on the second unit.  I have looked for cleaners and am in shock as to the price.  Also, once you add on HST the amount the cleaner is getting paid is more than what I am earning as a host at times.  Of course I can increase my price for my cleaning fee, but the reality of that is that I then have to decrease my nightly price to be more competitive.     I have a 3bdrm 1 bthm unit, standard kitchen, living room, bathroom, in addition to the basics I require my cleaners to wash towels and sheets and remake the beds, I do have an extra set of sheets for each bed so they can clean & make the beds as the laundry is washing/drying.  What I have found is in order to find someone dependable, (seems to be another issue as many cleaners say they understand airbnb cleaning but certainly dont because they say, oh I cant work Sundays, I cant do more than x hours, the last one I had here said she had been there long enough and needed to leave and left the home unfinished) you need to go with an agency or small group of cleaners and they all seem to charge around $130-140+HST.  I have done the cleanings myself when needed and find it takes me alone 2-3 hours maximum, which is $47 to $70 an hour.....   What do you pay?  What does it include?  What is the size of your unit?

Kevin557,30-08-2019 12:06 AM,"Nashville, TN","So I know some of you will say this is just the cost of doing business, but my cleaners charged me an extra $30 for a ""bio hazard"" fee because the guests had vomited. I'm guessing that the guests attempted to clean it up somewhat but it was still all over the baseboards, the wall and a door as well. They were also extra messy, ruining several towels, doing a number on our glass stove top, and breaking a luggage rack. I also cleaned up vomit on the exterior step outside the front door. This all came after they asked for a discount (does that surprise anyone) and I gave them a special offer which incorporated my usual $35 cleaning fee.   I have now asked them to pay the extra $30 fee that my cleaners charged me, while just racking up the rest of the stuff as the cost of doing business. They have not responded to this request for 24 hours and I'm guessing they won't. The lack of a response wants to make me also charge them another $30 for the broken luggage rack too. Should I escalate it and how should I expect ABB to handle it?   I'm also expecting to receive my first bad review, even though I have over 100 5 star reviews. I really hate the Airbnb damage claim system and how it leaves us open to retaliatory reviews.   I would be open to suggestions on how to review them, keeping in mind the mess, damage and that they violated a house rule we have about sleeping on the sofa without sheets. (We ask guests using the sofa to pull out the sofa bed and use sheets, but to not sleep on top of the cushions, which they apparently did for 5 nights..    "

Robert8724,19-11-2024 04:49 AM,"Fremantle, Australia","Having travelled extensively using self contained AirBnB apartments (with kitchens) in south east asia, there is always the same problem- linen, or the lack of. 
The host almost always fails to provide any tea towels and hand towels. The only linen provided is usually 1 bath towel per person. (So just two towels for a double bedroom apartment). It is a huge negative and makes me want to reluctantly switch to hotel style accommodation. 
AirBNB need to fix this problem, and I do see it as a huge problem because it’s consistent and a big let down for people who book 1-2 weeks especially those who travel lightly and shouldn’t have to cart their own bath towels, hand towels or kitchen dish towels around OMG! 
AirBnB should change the rules for hosting so multiple bath towels , tea towels and hand towels are available for people who book say more than 4 nights. I often stay 1-2 weeks and it is a pain in the ass to keep requesting linen or room cleaning after 5-6 days. 
If you want use the kitchen you need ‘tea towels’ .   CLEANING: also cleaning should be mandatory  every 5th day especially as most apartments don’t have any available cleaning supplies (it’s usually always stored away in a locked cupboard). 

SUMMERY: Lift your game AirBnB as guests should not have to hassle and negotiate with hosts for cleaning and linen! "

Julieanna0,24-05-2020 04:09 PM,"San Antonio, TX","Although my Airbnb listing has been paused during the COVID crises, I had a Realtor friend who had a client who needed a place to stay while purchasing a home.  Although it was only supposed to be for 2 weeks, it unfortunately turned into 2 months.  The worst part about the whole experience is the fact that my guest vaped in spite of the Realtor telling him my home was a smoke and vape free environment prior to renting it,--and of course, I went over the same rules.  The apartment in my home that he rented now smells like an old and dirty Super 8.   Bottom line,--he chose to vape for 2 months solid, almost never leaving my home.  I've looked up how to clean up after someone who has vaped and it doesn't look very encouraging.  It appears that vaping leaves an oil on everything that is difficult to clean from any permeable surface, (i.e. bedding, curtains, etc.)  I've also read that it gets in the heating/cooling ducts, and I'm going to leave that to the professionals.   However, before I throw away all of the bedding and upholstered furniture, does anyone have any experience, tips or suggestions as to how to clean up after something like this?  I really am a clean freak,--and I want things clean,--I don't just want to mask the smell.  I will be eternally grateful to anyone who has any help to offer!   ~Julieanna    "

Do you tend to include these in the listing price (thus increasing your price and paying booking fees and taxes on an amount which is actually a cost) or do you charge for them separately? I have tried to charge separately based on usage but received mixed feedback and guests do not like to have additional fees to pay when they leave (apart from cleaning fees which can be clearly detailed in the listing). Thanks for your help!"
Bradley-and-Melissa0,18-01-2019 08:17 PM,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Please...Please...Please! Allow for the cleaning fees to be isolated on payouts. As a host for multiple owners, I have taxpayer information for them and myself within my account. They receive their percentage and I receive my percentage but I am paying for cleaning services out of pocket. This requires me to bill my owners for the portion of the cleaning fee that I didn't originally collect. It is a nightmare for accounting and especially for taxes. "
Chamaine0,27-05-2018 05:55 AM,"Shalimar, FL","Hello   I own a small elite cleaning Service and I co host for a few Super Host and Clean for others.  Here is the problem. Lately we have had reviews complaining about the cleaning fee. These are whole houses or condos some located on the beach. We have nothing but 5 stars for our cleanliness and the in the same review that one raves about how clean the home is they also complain about paying a fee.  We are in a tourist area (Destin FL) and my fees are below that of local management companies.    The complaints have mainly come from people on short stays who think they should pay less. Rather they are there 1 night or 10 the house doesn’t get any smaller the work still has to be done. Bedding has to be washed and changed in every room , towels and so forth. The furniture still has to be vacuumed as our beautiful sand gets everywhere. Every surface has to be cleaned , floors mopped.  I’ m just be fuddled how someone can leave a hand written note for the cleaning staff about our attention to detail and how they have never stayed in a rental so clean then complain about the fee which was clearly listed at the time of booking.   Now with the new Supper Host requirements my owners are nervous over the 4 stars for Value Because of fees bringing down their standings. They have asked me to come up with something to include in their listings but I’m unsure if this is what to do. Any Ideas ?"
Camille617,17-09-2021 09:47 AM,"Westmont, IL",I and my family are currently at an airbnb and it's really bothering how unclean our Airbnb is. We are paying cleaning fees for a wipe down..... there's a rug in the living room that's dirty. It look like it hasn't been vacuumed in years. We have a toddler with us so he's on the floor more than any of us. My main suggestion is can Airbnb create their own cleaning team to go to these properties before guest check in and if the owners deny to allow Airbnb to clean on their behalf they should be charged additional fees as it doesn't look like the cleaning fee is being used properly. I went in the bathroom to switch out the toilet paper and the new roll had throw up on it.

Nirala0,26-09-2019 09:35 PM,"Waterloo, Canada","Hi there,  I offer guests staying over 7 nights a cleaning visit at least 1x week.  For my current guests (3rd time visiting), the cleaner reported that the place was extremely messy- dirty dishes, food lying around, caked on food on cupboard, garbage left inside etc.  She also believes they smoke, disregarding the no-smoking rule.  Nevertheless, she was not very happy about the amount of cleaning she did on this visit.  I messaged the guests to remind them of the no-smoking rule and to keep the place tidy - that dirty dishes, food lying around and garbage can encourage rodents.  The guests wrote back saying she will discuss my concerns after her vacation, and to let the cleaner know they won't be needing her for the duration of their stay (which will be over a week unattended), and that they will leave the place as they found it.  Since the location is in the tropics, things can get really nasty, buggy, and caked on if left alone.  Previous guests behavior did encourage a rat inside which caused some damages to linens/pillows, and took over a week to get rid of.  The guests don't have any cleaning supplies except for a mop/broom.   What would you do?  Let it fly and not send up the cleaner?  "

Art-and-Val0,10-10-2019 10:35 PM,"Bellingham, WA","Our Airbnb suite includes a stove/oven which our guests have been free to use.  Prior to each guest we insure that the oven is clean. Unfortunately, the oven is not self cleaning and we have had a few guests who have used the oven to cook greasy food which splatters all over the inside of the oven.  Manually cleaning of the oven takes 1 - 1 1/2 hours.   We do charge a $40 cleaning fee but don't feel that fee is sufficient for cleaning the oven. Thinking of adding to house rules a restriction on what is cooked in oven and if oven found dirty after guest checks out, we will charge an additional cleaning fee.  Our guests appreciate having an oven to use, so don't want to remove it. Any suggestions or thoughts on how to handle this situation. Thanks"

Lis15,18-03-2018 12:43 PM,"Genneteil, France","I have just joined AirBnB as a host. I own 2 gites (holiday homes in France) of which one has been listed here. The generally accepted situation here is that gite clients leave the place as they find it - clean, tidy and sanitised, essentially ready for the next occupants. The host (me) of course, will change bed linen, towels, handtowels and kitchen linen etc. between sets of guests - but unlike a hotel where one rents a room, the provision here is a spacious self-catering 'cottage'  - which is uneconomical to rent out for a low nightly rate if it is provided clean and ready to use but the client abuses the situation and leaves dirty dishes, pans, dirty floors and surfaces and unsanitised bathrooms when they leave. Also, it isn't easy to have to clean our gite from top to bottom in the time between check out and next potential check in later the same day.   Is that what is meant by 'Cleaning before checkout' which is one of the amenities which can be 'checked' ?  I have added a 'cleaning fee' at the moment but if clients 'leave as they find' then this isnt necessary. I'd appreciate any feedback on this. Lis"

Ros0,06-09-2020 08:01 AM,"Richmond, United Kingdom","Hi all After two rounds of renting out both rooms on a longer-term lodging site, I have decided to reserve the second room I have in my house solely for short-term/AirBnB lettings but any time I try and read up on the requirements for cleaning it is all US based and adhering to their standards.   UK-based hosts - what measures are you taking in between guests.   I haven't had this room back on AirBnB since the loft extension was completed and the two 'downstairs' rooms were completely refurbished solely for renting out - I opted to use another site to let out to longer-term lodgers but in a post-COVID environment, it seems a lot easier to only have one long-term lodger in the larger room, and to keep the smaller room for much more transient guests.   I have seen great suggestions like hand-sanitiser in the room, masks - all doable now that stocks seem to be plentiful, and I keep the shared areas clean myself.   Anything else I should be doing?

Thomas2429,16-07-2021 06:35 PM,"Bath, United Kingdom","Hi, I've been an Airbnb host off and on since 2013. I've also stayed in many Airbnbs with no issue. However I've just had the interesting experience of being a guest and being asked to pay an additional cleaning fee as we apparently left the place in a 'terrible condition'.   For context, we paid £1,500, including the Airbnb service fee and an £80 cleaning fee for a 7 night stay in a large 3 bedroom/3 bathroom house. This was a quiet family stay of 6 adults and a baby across 3 generations. The host is new to hosting, and lives several hours from the property and relies on a cleaning company to turn the property around between guests. We had to wash the towels on our arrival as they smelled quite musty, like they'd been sitting in a damp washing machine for some time before being dried.    Apart from being horrified at being accused of this, I just wanted to gauge opinion to see if we might be in the wrong here. I'll try to give the facts as neutrally as possible.    I did the final walk around before leaving the house. I looked for instructions on what to do with bedding and towels, but there were none, so we left the bed turned back and put the dirty towels in the bath. I went through every room, all crockery and glassware was washed and put away (dishwasher was left empty), all rubbish was sorted into recycling bags and stacked in the bins outside the house (collection day was not for a few days, so aside from going to the dump, we had no option but to leave it here).    The host asked us to pay a further £80, as apparently it took the cleaners 8 hours rather than 4 to clean the house. There was no documentary evidence, just what the cleaner had told them. This is the sum of what was passed to us: - house in a mess - kitchen was 'filthy' - grease on worktop - bins left full - some pants were left in a bed - toilets were dirty   As an Airbnb host myself, I feel 100% happy that we left the house tidy. It is absolutely true to say that the house was not cleaned before we left, and the pants in the bed thing was definitely unfortunate.. but my feeling is that cleaning of the property is the responsibility of the host between stays, particularly if a cleaning fee has already been charged. I also feel that 4 hours to clean a property as large as this, along with changing the beds etc. is possibly not long enough anyway.    We refused the charge, the host said he'd cancel the request as it was just our word against the cleaners, and without being on site, he'd have to give us the benefit of the doubt. He said he would expect people to leave the house much as they found it, but admitted that there was no instruction of this anywhere in the house manual. We left a polite but honest review to which we had a very angry response, calling us liars and telling us to never book his property again.    Feeling somewhat wounded by the whole affair! But some honest opinions would be helpful for our future stays, maybe we should have cleaned the place, or maybe this host expects too much of his guests. What do you think?"
Jo723,27-01-2022 03:05 AM,"Kiama Downs, Australia","Apologies this is a long post, but I'm feeling VERY unsupported by AirBnB and therefore looking for advice from the hosting community given this awful situation.  Please note that this guest completed their 6 night stay indicating they really enjoyed their stay and no word of complaint or negative feedback over this period of time.    After two night of excessive noise beyond midnight, I phone AirBNB to get their advice on how to handle the situation that our guest was not adhering to the house rules which indicate guests must minimise their noise after 10pm as it is a very quiet residential area.  AirBnB provided me with suggested wording and I flagged that if I approached them about this issue they may well provide me with a negative feedback as a result and was assured that any review as such could be requested to be removed.  I sent this message on the third day of their stay and did not receive any acknowldgement or response but the noise did not continue past 10pm for the remainder of their stay.  On departure the studio was filthy and required an extra hour of cleaning for which I sent a request for $22.50 (yes, very minimal cost) and the cost of a replacement latex pillow which they had taken from the studio and replaced in our pillow case their old dirty pillow with their name on it ($50).   I am deeply upset and concerned that in response the guest has put in a request for financial compensation for the full cost of their stay.  The complaint is full of spurious claims and lies after they enjoyed their 6 night stay. No issue was raised to me or AirBnb during their stay and they clearly don't meet the requirement to have started an issue within 24 hours of arrival..... as the AirBnB policy states.  :

I am now under scrutiny by AirBnB and had to provide a lengthy response addressing all of their nonsensical claims which are malicious and completely untrue which range from indicating we did not supply a powerpoint on a kitchen bench, to lies about the state of cleanliness and missing items.    I am also looking for support and advice from other hosts who may have been through a similar process as it now feels as though I am under question when in fact it is the guest to stole a pillow and left the studio in a state which required an additional hour of cleaning.  My initial claim for reimbursement appears to be on hold while AirBnB entertains this guests request for a full refund after completing their stay.   I have a 4.9 star rating and 50+ reviews which contradict this guest's claims.   What should I do now?   Policy for raising requests for refunds: Start a request within 24 hours If you still need to cancel your reservation during your stay, we can help you start a request to resolve the issue with your Host. When you do this, you can choose to ask your Host to fix the problem, request a partial refund, or request to cancel your reservation for a full refund. Your Host will then have 1 hour to respond to your request. If they decline or don’t respond, you can ask Airbnb to step in to help."

Jeff541,30-01-2019 09:33 PM,"Phoenix, AZ","  As an Airbnb Host we are allowed under the Airbnb system to offer a posted room rate (just like any hotel) and also charge a ""cleaning fee"" which the guest making the reservation will ONLY SEE once they proceed to make a reservation. Both are added together to in essence equal a ""TOTAL nightly room rate"" (before taxes etc.).   After reading Airbnb and others advice I offered my home at a very low room rate with a high cleaning fee (encourage long term stays etc.). My ""TOTAL nightly room rate"" was still far less than the local hotels, and all the other Airbnb listings in my area...however a recent guest (self-admitted ""anal retentive clean freak"") seemed motivated by (her words) my ""extremely high cleaning fee"" (ignoring the low ""Total Room rate""). This seemed to prompt her to fabricate stories about the cleanliness of my home and request that the entire fee be paid to her directly.   The average cleaning fee charged in my area is $150...I charged double or $300 (don't want short term stays etc.) but after the hassle-time of dealing with the former guest I am considering dropping the fee entirely to $0...and increase my room rate (Hotels use this format all the time...in essence cleaning & damages & consumables etc. are included in the room rate)   What’s your thoughts???   Charge $0 (increase rates a lot)… Charge $150 (increase rates to match others) ...Keep it at $300 (my low room rates remain) IT IS NOT worth it to me to go through arguing over ""cleaning"" refunds again...was a pain!!! I am thinking this guest was motivated by high fee???...but maybe such requests happen no matter what the fee is?...I don’t know… Thanks All    "

Carol5235,26-12-2019 02:11 PM,"Conroe, TX","I just stayed at an apartment in Paris with 10 people for 4 nights.  A cleaning fee was charged ahead of time, which I knew about and expected.  Upon arrival, our towels were still wet in the dryer and I told our host it was not a problem.  There was a mop bucket full of mop water left in the water closet area.  2 of our duvet covers were still wet, yet placed on the bed, but I did not make a fuss about either of these things - I just thought, it is what it is. I did inform our host that we were celebrating Christmas (as the dates for our stay included Christmas Day), so there would certainly be excess trash due to gift opening.  I asked him what I should do with the extra trash and if he would like me to separate the cardboard out.  He pointed to some trash bags and said yes to the cardboard. We vacuumed up every day and washed all of our dishes.  There was, however, quite a bit of excess trash but it was all bagged up, and the cardboard was all broken down and stacked up.  We were not asked to strip linens, so we did not. I tried for 24 hours prior to departure to make contact with the host regarding check out procedures and he never replied.  Finally, about 15 minutes after check out, we decided to leave the key with the front office of the building. On our drive home, I received a phone call from the host telling me that I was disrespectful and filthy.  I am floored and confused.  I asked him to send me some pictures of what he was referring to.  He sent pictures of literally minuscule pieces of trash like a wrapper under a bed or a clothing tag in a corner?!  There were things left in the fridge upon our arrival, so we left those things there, plus a couple of our own, that could be useful to the next person.  Am I being unreasonable?  I really do not understand."

For example sales and county taxes are based on % of rental sales + cleaning fee.  I have no idea how to incorporate a tax where the % calculation includes the cleaning fee.   For Example:  $1000 rental rate x 6% sales tax = tax to pay state Correct way:  $1000 rental rate + $300 cleaning fee = $1300 x 6% sales tax = tax to pay state   Any ideas? Thank you in advance.

Dawn241,29-01-2022 07:44 PM,"Sierra Vista, AZ",We have a 2 night minimum and 3 night maximum. We charge $49 for cleaning. It cost me that much for gas to make the four hour round trip to clean. We have very strong  language in our house rules about excessive cleaning and still we just had a lady with two kids turn the place upside down.   I’ve debated not charging a cleaning fee and telling people to clean back to how it was when they arrived or refunding cleaning fee if they leave the place as it was when they arrived but there are loopholes with both. People that don’t pay a cleaning fee won’t clean and people will want a refund even if they don’t clean. I don’t really have a solution but I have seen an increase in excessive cleaning in the past two years.    I remember seeing a video that Airbnb was going to allow hosts to start tracking guests with excessive cleaning and undisclosed guests right before pandemic started but it never came to fruition.

The night before leaving, the host sends me a list of chores to do.... even though she initially charged the big cleaning fee. We are up late studying and have class the morning of check out, so we will be out of the apartment around 7:45 am even though checkout is not until 10:00 am. Is is not appropriate to ask us to do all the chores when there is a large cleaning fee, and it is not our responsibility to have the place in order for the next PAYING guests. Can the host charge me after the fact if we don't clean it? If we do find the time to clean it, can I request my $180 cleaning fee be reimbursed? Any insight would be appreciated! Thank you! "

Lorissa0,22-05-2019 02:27 AM,"Denver, CO","I have been bumping up against an AirBnB dilemma that I would love other hosts’ opinions on. As a host I charge a fair ($25) cleaning fee for our one bedroom/one bathroom rental. My husband and I turn the space over on our own and can clean it in one hour or less. Our home is new (less than 2 years old) and we have very high cleaning standards for our rental. We regularly clean baseboards, windows, corners for cobwebs, you get the idea. My dilemma is in regards to traveling as an AirBnb guest. Because I know the behind the scenes of hosting I am of course much more particular. On a recent vacation we rented a studio apartment that added on an $85 cleaning fee. I felt that was fairly high but realizing I was traveling to a beach town figured the host was just trying to add on some extra $$ to her payout and show a bit lower nightly renal fee to potential guests. My qualm came when I showed up to the bnb rental and saw the dust, hair, dirty walls/cabinets, etc. Whomever is cleaning the space is doing a less than adequate job and certainly not deep cleaning ever.  To make matters worse there was a sign above the sink threatening renters to incur an additional $25 fee if they did not do their dishes. There was also a list of other check out chores including trash, etc.  Am I crazy in my thinking that it is ridiculous to be asking your guests to be cleaning the space after you’ve charged them quite a large cleaning fee?! What is the cleaning fee for? As I said I’m an experienced host so I get what it takes and I never micromanage my guets regarding their cleaning duties. And 9/10 times we have lovely guests who do the right thing without our asking! I prefer the idea of bringing out the best in others by extending trust  rather than micromanaging which usually seems to backfire anyhow.  I’d love to hear other hosts’ thoughts on this matter!

Alan192,05-03-2019 04:10 PM,"Ottawa, Canada","After four years of hosting, most of the time being a Super Host, and having a 5 star rating for cleanliness; AIRBNB began a new feature where a guest can give a host an additional accolade in their review by clicking on ""sparkling clean"".  Sounds good right?  However, now at the top of my listing page the first thing guests see is ""9% of recent guests said this place is sparkling clean"".  If someone looking for a place sees this, what would they think?  I  would interpret this as meaning 91% don't find it clean.  Since AIRBNB put this on my listing, my bookings have gone to zero.  I spoke with AIRBNB and they tell me the 5 stars for cleanliness is still on the page, the prospective guest has to scroll down to see this.  Guests have no way on knowing this ""sparkling clean"" mention is an addition to reviews.  If this is the first thing I see at the top of the page, I would not scroll down, I would move on, as I would conclude that it is not clean, according to 91%, since only 9% said it was sparkling clean.  Based on the bookings, even an inquiry, dropping to zero since this was implemented, it would seem  I am not alone in my perception of what this means.  I have asked AIRBNB to remove it, but of course it is a system  thing and they cannot.  Has anyone else noticed on their page this attribution, and if so, have your bookings declined?  "

I didn't think too much about it at the moment, but have been thinking about that the past few days.   Has anyone ever done or heard of such a thing? I imagine it could convince some guests to be clean and even do some of the cleaning themselves if it was known they could get part of the cleaning fee returned. Is there a downside to that?

Don't even need AI for a simple data crunch like that. Breed gives the hair length and loss and if the dog is spastic. Size - Obvious .  Bed or Cage. A small docile , short hair with low shed rate is going to jump out of the numbers. A big sweet Lab is never a problem. Many other breeds are a nightmare and if there are 2 of them  I'd double rate, keep it low according to the code. A code would be cool.  Dogs get different codes because the variation in dog breeds is so great so save me the dog discrimination BS.   Sincerely, Ward "

This reminded me that a while ago, some hosts in the community mentioned using sustainable cleaning products or even homemade cleaning products!   Over the years, there have been many changes concerning cleaning products. For instance, some laundry detergents use less packaging, and are more eco-friendly. Recommendations on washing laundry are usually also noted on the back of the package, mentioning that washing laundry at a lower temperature/eco-mode can help save energy and water.     About 2/3 years ago, I decided to switch over to more eco-friendly cleaning products. I decided changing my dish soap, dishwasher tablets, handwash, laundry detergent, disinfectants, and many more products to more eco-friendly ones. One of my colleagues @Francesca, even made an eco/natural soap bar which I was able to use for quite some time 🧼.    Are you conscious of your cleaning products? Which tips and recommendations would you give your fellow hosts?   I look forward to hearing your answers.   Quincy"

Guests are typically pretty good about cleaning counters and the stove tops, but opening the oven after a recent guest was like entering a deep circle of hell. My cleaners did the best they could but we had to finish it up so they could go to their next job in a timely manner. It took probably 3 hours to get the crud scrubbed off and the oven looking decent. I think some of what we removed was melted plastic.   We leave oven cleaner and our range is less than 2 years old. Its clear to me that some people are not familiar with cleaning an oven and don't notice that they have left a chaotic, greasy, splattery mess on the inside. Its not something that happens very often, but when it does, it is a real pain in the behind. Does anyone have any hacks on how to either a) clean a messy oven quickly and efficently or b) help guests to understand what to do (or not) to make a mess in the first place?

On other platforms, I use the term ""maintenance fee"" as a one off fee per booking instead, this allows for not just change of sheets and regular cleaning between guest, but replacement of stained/damaged items, and all that needs higher cost. I wish Airbnb would allow a distinction between cleaning fee and cleaning service and offer both options as add on. therefore for me, it would make things easier if Airbnb would either use the term maintenance fee or allow the host to write in the term as wished for the one off fee. Plus allow an add on cleaning service fee per day, because this service can be optional. What are your reflexion and solutions about it? thanks  "

Send this to airbnb and don’t give up!!   Subject: Urgent Complaint - Developer Error Resulting in Zero Cleaning Fee and Unresolved Refunds Dear Airbnb Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and concern regarding a significant issue on the Airbnb platform that has been causing financial losses to hosts. Recently, there has been a critical oversight or error in your system that has resulted in the short-term cleaning fees being set to zero for many listings. This issue not only affects the host's ability to maintain their property but also has a direct financial impact on them. Many guests rely on accurate pricing, which includes cleaning fees, to make informed booking decisions. What is more troubling is the fact that Airbnb has not taken proactive measures to refund the affected hosts for the revenue they have lost due to this error. The responsibility for this mistake should not be placed on the hosts, who rely on Airbnb for a fair and efficient platform for their short-term rental business. I urge Airbnb to take immediate action to rectify this situation: 1. Address the Developer Error: Airbnb should work swiftly to identify and rectify the developer error causing the short-term cleaning fee to be set to zero. This should be a top priority to ensure the integrity of the platform. 2. Compensate Affected Hosts: Airbnb must take responsibility for the financial impact on hosts and provide refunds for the lost cleaning fees during the period when the error occurred. 3. Improve Communication: Hosts should be kept informed about the progress of resolving this issue. Transparency is crucial in rebuilding trust. Failure to address this matter promptly could have a lasting negative impact on Airbnb's reputation and the trust of hosts in your platform. I trust that Airbnb, as a respected and reputable company, will take immediate action to rectify this situation and ensure that hosts are fairly compensated for the losses they have incurred. I look forward to a swift resolution to this issue. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, [Your Name]

I also love the 'amazon-like' experience that I don't have to enter any bidding wars and I can just shop for my cleaners knowing the price upfront. It's not perfect, but it's taken a huge load off my plate   Now, I'm curious, how do YOU all tackle the cleaning process? Any secret weapons?

Ryan-and-Darnie0,10-02-2021 09:51 PM,"SF, CA","Hello all,   For one of our listings we have nearly 100 reservations already confirmed for this year. Obviously, all fees were set at the time of confirmation, so all of these reservations have a set cleaning fee.    But, our housekeeper recently informed us of a significant rate increase (44% increase) for all cleans going forward. The result will be a significant operational cost increase for this listing since we can't pass the increase on to our guests as I suspect there is no way to apply this rate increase to existing reservations, correct? (and I'm not sure that would really be fair anyway.. although, do hotels charge fees at reservation or check out? it's been a while).    We can't be the only ones to have faced this before, anyone have any advice?    Thanks!"
Cj61,23-03-2023 10:15 AM,"Darwin, Australia","My listing is at the bottom end of my town listings. Price-wise I am one of the lowest. I have just received a booking for one month which has a good discount on my nightly price.   I wanted to ask other hosts if they think I should clean the room (a room in my shared house) during the guest's stay. I have normally provided cleaning products and equipment, and clean sheets and towels each week. Is this sufficient? I only charge one small ($A10) cleaning fee which only covers the cost of cleaning products and replacement cleaning aids (brooms, etc.).   I would not normally enter a guest's room once they have arrived unless it was for pre-arranged maintenance or if there was a health and safety concern. Can anyone offer me advice?

I have cleaning fees applied to my listing  and it covers the cost my cleaner charges me to clean the place after guests have left. Mostly this has been fine HOWEVER on two occasions now the oven has been used to cook obviously pork or something similar and there has been fat and honey type stuff stuck all over the inside and has taken a professional cleaner to come out and clean it. My cleaner will wipe down the oven but this is far beyond anything other than a professional oven cleaner could tackle.  Should I mention in house rules that there will be extra fees if the oven isn't left as it was when guests arrive? And if that’s the case how do I add that? what is the best way?

Adhina1,19-12-2022 07:27 AM,"St Paul, MN","Hi everyone, As I’ve seen a lot of hosts expressing their concern with the major decline in bookings, some hosts are recommending to take off the cleaning fee and raise the nightly price.    I’ve so far had a very booked 2 unit duplex, but I am now experiencing a HUGE decline into the upcoming year. It looks like most listings in my area and maybe even across the Airbnb platform are also in the same boat. Whether it’s from Airbnb’s new Summer Release update, market saturation, inflation, a slow down after the post pandemic vacation surge or a little bit of everything, I’m interested in seeing how other hosts are compensating.    I’m wondering if any hosts have gone this route and are experiencing an uptick in bookings. It would seem that a cleaning fee is annoying, considering Airbnb tacks on extra fees as well. The total price could be a shock for guests to see at checkout and turn interested travelers away. On the other hand though, raising the nightly price to adjust could potentially be an even bigger turn off.    I’m set to list another property within the next month but I am majorly concerned with how slow things are right now. Any tips and tricks would be appreciated.    Thanks! "

Jill1084,12-11-2021 12:13 AM,"White Rock, Canada","I have a busy vacation rental in Whistler, BC. Cleaning companies  are expensive and hard to find and generally don't provide great services - they tend to be young ski bums... Having said that, I have used the same company for the past 2 years who are at least reliable. They don't do a super job, but they show up at least and I have had very few guest complaints.   I recently upgraded my washer and dryer to a full size set - used to have an old apartment sized set. They used to take some of my laundry out because they couldn't get it all done in time if it was a same day check out/check in. Now they can, and I'm still finding other people's linens/towels mixed in with my things. I am also able to track the cycles on an app and they are doing 5 loads of laundry each clean (when I clean the unit myself it is 2-3 loads max). I am very suspicious that they are using my place as their laundromat! I was even informed by a neighbour that they have been seen arriving and leaving with what appeared to be a full laundry bag.   I'm looking for advice on how to approach this. I don't want to risk losing their service, as I don't think it will be easy to find someone now, heading into the busy ski season, but I feel I need to say something. I'm sure they will deny anything, and I can't really accuse them at this point. I am installing a video doorbell soon, but I feel I shouldn't need to do this! Ugh...    Any suggestions would be appreciated! Anyone has had a similar experience?"

Jill963,05-01-2021 10:50 PM,"Spokane, WA","Let me start by saying I'm a superhost and have been for years.  I've hosted plenty of guests and try to make it explicitly clear what/how to leave everything so that we can each leave each other good reviews.  Anyway, I had some guests stay a month.  For the most part good communication and no issues until I arrived home to see significant splatter on my walls from food. It was all over the cupboards, the wall, and somehow even in the living room.  A drawer in the kitchen needed to be repaired and wouldn't close, and there was a large stain on the carpet. I tried to use the resolution center and the guest lost their mind.  Very defensive, says they didn't do any of it and why are they even paying a cleaning fee if I'm not going to clean all that.  The thing is that I'm not 'deep' cleaning the house every time someone checks out.  I'm not planning on scrubbing walls, or shampooing the carpet after every guest.  Because the guest was so rude I wasn't going to engage with them anymore through messaging and I just wrote a truthful review after their rude message. The guest is angry now that they can't respond to me (I blocked them) but I honestly don't have time to argue with people that are instantly offended and take no responsibility for their actions.  The pictures clearly show damage and mess.  If it were me I would be embarrassed I left such a mess and wouldn't have been so ridiculous in my response when the owner reached out. Needless to say I wrote a review after their ridiculous response.   Hoping Air B n B actually does something about my request.  "
Krystal16,03-08-2018 11:34 PM,"Toronto, Canada","Sorry about the book, and the double posting I am not seeing alot of trackon in the hosting board   I have a dilemma, and I am looking for constructive advice/suggestions.  I live in the largest city in Canada, I am happy to call both Toronto and Canada my home.  I live in the suburbs of Toronto and I have a full time Airbnb near two post-secondary institutions that I run.  The issue with living in the suburbs is that it is very hard to find the type of cleaning service required for Airbnb in my area.  I can’t have just one person do the cleaning as they won’t always be available, regular cleaners have clients say on every other Thursday and as we know Airbnb cleanings are on the day of check out and only between the hours of 11 & 3.    I posted an ad on Kijiji (Canadian version of Craig’s List) and luckily, I was able to find a company.  It worked out good in the beginning like all do (except for me having to show them how to fold sheets and how to make a bed hotel style) but the cleaning has gotten worse and worse and worse.  I am getting negative comments on my reviews about the quality of the cleaning and the linens (there is a washer & dryer in the unit and they are expected to wash towels & sheets) the smell even of the towels.  I changed one of the beds in one of the bedrooms and when I moved the side tables, the side tables had not been dusted in weeks, and that is part of their regular cleaning.   Of course I could quit my job, and do the cleaning myself, obviously not feasible, I could hire Molly Maid at $60 to $70 an hour and then have to pass that cost off the guests then the cleaning charge would be more than the nightly rate.  I have considered having my own household cleaner go in every 6 weeks and do a good cleaning after my cleaners had already been there, I will also be looking into getting a security system, I want to see how many hours they are truly spending in the unit cleaning.  I have complained to the owner, who also subcontracts people to do the work and basically what I have been told is that the cleaners feel they are doing a good enough job and with the time they are spending there and what they are being paid they don’t think it is worth it.  Do I alienate the only cleaner that will come to my area?  It would also be good to mention in January minimum wage went up close to 20%, they are not paid minimum wage, however everyone who is close to the new minimum wage with the increase is asking where their 20% raise is.   Fellow hosts, what would you do?  Any suggestions for me? Guests, would you be willing to pay an extra 100 to 150 in cleaning fees to ensure a higher quality of cleaning.  Also, important to note the majority do not have issues with cleaning, but that # is decreasing. "
Susan1188,06-05-2020 06:32 AM,"Marbella, Spain","The Covid cleaning requirements surely represent a ""new normal"" for this business.

The 3 page checklist, added work, added cleaning supplies and products, need to plan empty non-paid nights between stays, are all good initiatives but should not be considered ""free"" services!

Why was this cleaning guideline initiative, not accompanied with an initiative to charge a Covid participation for guests?

Surely most people will prefer to stay in a private space, instead of a hotel, and will agree to help the host provide extra deep cleaning and airing out between guests?  50 euros or some other fee, to help offset some (not all) of the cost?

Cleaning service, products, and extra empty nights are not free; hosts should be given a new category of extra charges per stay to make this transparent to guests."

No one should even be in the dwelling for 24 hours after guests leave and new guests arrive.  I don't know how people are doing a 24 hour turnaround. I find it mostly being impossible since they're claiming they're following protocol.   And then when I see all the crap that other listings have in their homes...there is no way those surfaces are being properly cleaned and sanitized. I doubt they were even cleaned pre COVID judging from some pictures I have seen on listings. You're not sanitizing that nasty ass chesterfield. You're not.    I believe that if you pass the course and you still choose to do the 72 hour shutdown for guest safety you should still get your badge or whatever ""Highlight""  to show potential guests that you took the course and passed it.

I think I feel that I need to share this and vent a little, but also would be grateful for any advice on how to respond.   We were pretty upset to wake up to the message below in our inbox. We do charge a small cleaning fee - I note we charge less than half of what we actually have to pay - We live circa 120 miles away from our apartment and have to pay a great company to service our apartment and also to be on call should our guests need anything at all, we do this to ensure we provide the best possible experience for our guests and we hope that this is reflected in our superhost status and consistently good reviews.   We need to answer the message to maintain our response rate with AirBnB and obviously want to remain courteous and kind and also to not answer emotionally (which is where I'm at right now), but we also feel that we need to explain to the inquirer (new AirBnB user) what the cleaning fee is for and why we have to charge it, so that they understand how AirBnB works - I feel that they have got the wrong idea.  We would do anything to rip anyone off, we are kind genuine loyal people, sharing our home and trusting people to look after it and as such feel really quite hurt by this.   Here's the message, be really great to hear your thoughts, thanks all...   ""Me and my partner nearly booked this this morning till I saw the £80 cleaning fee on top. To be honest I think that's outrageous, with all the rules set I don't understand how it could be that dirty to charge that amount of money. I've looked at other properties and most people don't even charge a cleaning fee, surely this is your responsibility as the owner. We are respectable adults and parents and would always clean up after ourselves and make sure the property was left in a good condition so to charge that amount is insulting which is a shame because it's a lovely property and I almost hit book button but I will be looking elsewhere now."""

I had guests check out and they left the house messy, garbage left on benches, food in fridge etc. guests are made aware that they have to leave house tidy, take garbage out, remove food from fridge. I tried to claim extra cleaning costs but Airbnb won’t support it, saying …” Host damage protection only covers for cleaning costs in excess of cleaning fees paid to or charged by a Host upon reservation. “.

Kat162,02-06-2020 03:00 PM,"Nova Scotia, Canada","Hello all!

Would someone be able to clarify what options we have as hosts with the up and coming Enhanced Cleaning feature.
Not sure if I am interpreting the info correctly released in this recent article from April ....  : (  https://www.airbnb.ca/resources/hosting-homes/a/answers-about-the-enhanced-cleaning-protocol-183

.... Are there 3 options for us?

1) Opt in for Enhanced Cleaning + 24 hr vacancy on either side of a reservation.
2) Opt in for Enhanced Cleaning yet not be able to comply fully; therefore still get a shout out from Air BnB that you give 72 hrs between reservations 3) Not Opt in; no Enhanced Cleaning badge yet STILL be cleaning & disinfecting your heart out following CDC guidelines (because what else should one be doing) ...all too ... not be shown as prominently in the search results??? 

As a host in a non-US country I am trying to prepare for what may come to protect my guests' reservations and my beloved space!

Thanks for you time! Hope you are all well, happy and healthy = )

I know what some of you are thinking . . . I get people hooked because I charge a lower rate for the room and then add the cleaning fee to it to make up the difference.  Personally I don't like it done that way and have not booked a reservation when I figure out that is what a host did.  I felt this was good food for thought and wanted to share with you.   P.S.  I was charging a $200 cleaning fee per stay prior to changing it to no cleaning fee and had a 2 night minimum.  Now I have a 7 day minimum and no cleaning fee.

I've been a loyal Airbnb user for over eight years, maintaining a clean record and always adhering to the rules. During our recent stay in Canmore, AB, everything went smoothly, and we checked out without any issues. However, more than two weeks after the stay, and after the review period had closed, the host submitted a request for payment, alleging a stained duvet that was not caused by us. I promptly questioned the host about the claim, only to be met with being blocked without clarification. To my dismay, Airbnb sided with the host, and I am left perplexed and frustrated about this unjust charge. I am turning to the Airbnb community for guidance on how to appeal this decision. Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to contest such a charge? Furthermore, how can one provide evidence that a particular issue was not caused by the guest? I appreciate any insights or advice you may have. Thank you in advance."

We paid £3000 for the property including service and a cleaning fee of £150.

I charge a $100 cleaning fee which covers our cleaning service and laundry for a weekly renter yet  my monthly guests are still provided with laundry and cleaning services that are costing me several times that fee.  With the increase of monthly renters, I wish that Airbnb would allow for charges designated specifically to this type of renter.

Jo824,26-08-2022 01:17 PM,"Gelderland, Netherlands","Hi,   Just wanted to share my experience.   I have been a host for 3 years, last 2 of those superhost. Suddenly this summer I got one lady guest who was upset that there were crumbs under a carpet, and a sock in the corner under one of the beds she did not use.   Me being the kind host offered to refund the cleaning fees. I thought - yes, there are people with mysophobia in this world. Poor them.
The lady accepted, but made sure in her review to post that she was not happy with the cleaning AND that I refunded, but that it was a traumatic experience for her anyway.    A month later - I get guests who complain there is a hair in the bathroom, and spots on a mirror, and that they were very disappointed. I had cleaned the place myself, found it hard to believe, but ok, I refunded again. (These guests by the way left cigarette buts allover the garden and terrace, food in the fridge, a waterballet in the bathroom etc).(and of course a sh*tty review)   Two weeks later (as in  yesterday) I get 3 young kids from Germany, they start to complain there is a spider cobweb in the house (it's in the forest, surprise!), there is a stain on a sheet that is used for storing garden pillows, they have paid for the cleaning... etc. You know what they are aiming for.   So after 3 years of no complaints whatsoever, I suddenly run a filthy house.  I get the feeling there are guests that read all the reviews for such a bit of information, and it will be used against you.  And you cannot win. Once a review is there, it's there to stay.   So - I will be taking my property off from AirBnB, as I do not wish to be part of this whole review circus.      "

Martin280,21-11-2018 01:50 AM,"New York, NY","Okay, I've looked at other posts and this has been mentioned time and again.    Let us set custom cleaning fees based on trip length and number of guests!  Let us remove cleaning fees for set dates on our calendar!   I can't manage my calendar effectively when I have 4 days open in a row on my calendar for example. If someone books the entire four days I want them to pay the full cleaning fee. It's reasonable then. But if someone is staying only 1 day I want them to pay a lot less. But I can't do this with the current system. So it hurts me for people who want to book single days because the rate seems exorbitant, because it's reasonable for someone whose booking it for all four days.    This is ridiculous airbnb. Let us change this so that we don't have this yo-yo pricing on our calendar because we're trying to hedge which type of reservation we might get and base our pricing on that including the cleaning.    I'm like other hosts, there is NO way I'm not charging for cleaning. It takes 9 hours to clean the entire apartment and some people are slobs. "
Darin57,25-07-2022 08:10 PM,"Dripping Springs, TX","The system did not charge a cleaning fee on our last booking.  The customer service agent seems clueless about how the system works, as she has suggested multiple options that would not address the issue: 1. Contact the guest directly and ask them to pay a cleaning fee.  This is an absurd suggestion for obvious reasons. The guest would think it's a scam and no doubt give us a bad review. 2. Check the box on our listing to reduce the cleaning fee for shorter stays.  Again - doesn't address the issue. 3. Use the Resolution Center to contact the guest and explain the situation.  You CAN'T use the Resolution Center for a guest who hasn't check in yet.  Why are the customer service folks so lame?    It's very disheartening to have such a simple issue that airbnb will not take ownership of and fix.  Now it looks like we have to cancel the reservation and hope that it works properly when the guest re-books. And we would pay a $50 fine for canceling the booking. "

Suzanne302,19-04-2019 02:01 PM,"Wilmington, NC","I just saw a homeshare listing with a cleaning fee of $50! The cleaning fee was higher than the nightly rate. Which got me thinking...Are there guests out there who would actually book this place?   I don't see how the host could justify a $50 cleaning fee. Mine is a modest $10, which I think is fair. I was thinking of raising it to $15.   What do other homeshare hosts charge? And does your nightly rate influence what you decided to charge? How do you justify your cleaning fee?"

Some hosts add a cleaning fee in their listing while others build it into the price.  Here is a Help Guide on how to add a cleaning fee to your listing.   ***NOTE: This Help Guide has been created using the new layout so if you have a different layout, please visit https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosts/Adding-a-Cleaning-Fee-A-Community-Help-Guide/m-p/53351#M24...   First of all, if you do not have the option to add a cleaning fee, you will need to publish your listing first and then the option will be available.  I recommend to publish your listing and then quickly unlist it so that you get the full editing options for your listing.   Step 1: Click on ""Host"" and then ""Manage Listings"" and then choose the listing you wish to add the cleaning fee to.      Step 2: From the choices, choose ""Pricing"" and then go to the ""Extra Charges"" section and choose Edit.

Sharon1074,29-03-2022 02:51 AM,"Wichita Falls, TX","Hello everyone! Although my listing is for one guest and no pets, my weekend guest brought her significant other and a dirty, large dog. Although I am in contact with Superhost Support (my rep is doing great), my concern is cleanup. I have removed all (or thrown away) any soft surfaces, aired out the suite for hours, cleaned every surface (and the air filters), and used enzyme cleaners, I still smell the dog. I used my UV light and did not see any messes, so this dog was just dirty and smelly. My questions are this: any tips of cleaning out a dirty dog smell? What measures do you use to make sure linens and surfaces are bug (mites) free? I'd rather not have my next guest have issues. As a side note, I've had service dogs before (guests have both let me know during reservation or when they come) and welcome them. This seemed to not be the case.   Thank you!"

Susan990,29-11-2021 08:41 PM,"Redmond, OR","The conversations about cleaning fees and ABB fees and Pricing displays deserves a good look at the way ABB explains these charges to the Guest consumer.  Place cursor on Cleaning fee and read "" This is the fee the Host charges to clean their property"" Now read the cursor message for Service fee and read "" this helps support this platform which provides 24/7 customer service"" or something similar. Notice the subtle distortion? My solution is to think like a Hotel and calculate the actual cleaning costs to run your Listing annually and divide by 365 days and you have your daily rate to stuff  in the nightly  price.   Then I add to the value of my places by stating in the marketing remarks-- No cleaning fees, security deposits, or additional charges. Flat rate pricing. Plus, for my area the high demand  for monthly stays rules the top of my market so I have set 31 day minimum reservation--what this does to the hotel/tourist/lodging taxes is it VOIDS them... not legally collectable on monthly reservations.  End result-- the only Fees added onto the price are the ABB fees. P.S.  I skip out on all the weekly, monthly discount section totally none of it for me.  This formula has worked very well.  Clean simple math. No confusion. Occupancy rate at 93% today."

Eloise26,01-09-2019 04:35 PM,"England, United Kingdom","Hello,   I'd like hosts' honest opinions on recent feedback I received from a host.   Context: We'd booked an entire house for a week as part of our honeymoon. We never saw the host in person as he lives 200 miles away.   His public review stated: ""the house was left dirty, and a window left open which could have resulted in water damage.""   It was a big house with lots of windows which we did check before leaving, I can only guess we hadn't latched one quite right and it managed to blow open. It was an honest mistake but I understand his frustration.   However, I don't understand the 'dirty' comment. Privately, he said:   ""It was disappointing to find the house had hardly been cleaned when we arrived yesterday. There were lots of bits of food etc under and around the dining room table - the floor clearly hadn't been hoovered. The kitchen hob hadn't been cleaned, neither had the worktops. An oven tray had been used and shoved back in the cupboard without being cleaned. Bathrooms weren't too bad but the downstairs one at least hadn't been cleaned properly.""   It seems the expectation was for us to leave the property exactly as we found it, which is an expectation he has since added to his listing. We followed the check out instructions (strip beds/take rubbish to kerbside bin /empty dishwasher/leave everything (in our own minds) clean and tidy) and there was no instruction to vacuum. We had wiped down the hob and worktops, there was no significant mess/spills/stains etc but we hadn't performed a deep clean. The baking tray was an oversight - I think my wife must've assumed I'd already cleaned it and put it away. I'd thoroughly cleaned the upstairs bathroom, but seeing as we'd only used the downstairs toilet a couple of times I hadn't given that much attention.   We've received positive feedback from other hosts and I wouldn't think much of it, just that the host has very high standards, if it wasn't for the fact that the host has left reviews of other guests complimenting how they left the house. During our stay we saw an older version of his house manual before it was updated, which asked guests to thoroughly clean and tidy everything to the same standard you would expect when arriving, as sometimes he does not visit in between guests, and telling guests where to find bed sheets to make the bed if they arrive when he hasn't been to the house in between. We thought this was quite strange and assumed it was unsustainable which is why it had been changed with less strict cleaning expectations, but based on his feedback it did seem as though those expectations are still there.   So, I'd genuinely like to know hosts' thoughts and their expectations for how clean guests leave their own properties, especially with regards to vacuuming/bathroom cleaning.   Thank you!"

Marianne294,17-11-2020 12:17 AM,"Winchester, TN","I urge Airbnb to keep the cleaning protocol solely voluntary. It’s great for those hosts to stand out with a cleaning protocol badge, and for guests who are especially concerned about that to be able to find those properties.   If a host voluntarily says they follow the protocol, they are more likely to diligently follow it. Moreover, if guests find evidence that they didn’t, the guests’ reviews hold that host/property accountable. On the other hand, if Airbnb threatens all hosts into following the protocol, I’m sure some hosts will not be as diligent, and guests are sure to discover that. If all are said to follow the standard and even one proves not to, the standard becomes meaningless and goes from goodwill to bad. I would think it could even open Airbnb and hosts up to lawsuits.   Although I appreciate the protocol as a cleaning help, I personally prefer not to mark my property as under the cleaning protocol. There’s still too much unknown about COVID, and it’s impossible to clean every inch of a house and the things in it. (Think about a deck of cards even!) I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking my house is totally sanitized against COVID. If I were high risk and felt that COVID posed a threat to my life, I’d stay home or do my own sanitizing wherever I went. I don’t want to give my guests that false COVID-free assurance that no one can give.   I love Airbnb. It’s simplicity and the way the ratings work to hold everyone accountable for themselves is brilliant. I appreciate the low overhead that Airbnb charges which I think comes with that simplicity. I urge Airbnb to keep this cleaning protocol voluntary, allowing individuals (both hosts and guests) to determine their own priorities. Let hosts decide what they want to offer, and let guests decide what they’re looking for."

J-Renato0,13-12-2021 04:17 PM,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","   Without  ideas to write a post this year, I decided to share a piece of furniture designed by me.
You can call it daybed, clean sofa design, multi use sofa or whatsoever. Obviously it's nothing very original. The difference from many industrialized ones is that I have it in the exact measurements I want to. When you have something to let short term or mid term, especially a furnished apartment, you have to deal with space constraints, unless you're talking about a very large apartment.
This is not the case of my listings. Keeping this idea in mind, every minimum space counts.
I keep in mind that I don't want to use lots of space to put furniture. I just want to put the minimum furniture necessary to make the environment comfortable, cozy and functional. I avoid large furniture, as I want to leave as much space as possible, so that guests don't feel compressed or crowded. So it's from this logic of thought that I designed the first sofa some time ago that you see in the photo. There is another one in the picture, I think is the 4th edition of the original design
Yes, I've been replicating the first one in other 4 listings. It can be used as a sofa during the day.
And if you remove the backrest, it can be used to sleep at night, that is, for short periods of time. It is practical and functional, within the concept ""Less is more"" (coined by Mies van der Rohe). I wanted something customized, with the exact measurements I wanted to, but taking into account concepts of good ergonomics too, for seating. And also to sleep for short periods of time. So I designed it and mounted it.
I ordered the planks cut to exact measurements. And then I just drill the holes and assemble it using bolt. As for the upholstery, it's foam that I order, cut to the exact size I want and to the degree of firmness I want to.
As for the coating, it is fabrics. And for this, I count with the help of my wife  to cover the foams  As I said before, I have used it in several listings with good results. I wish you all the best. Happy Christimas, Happy Universal Holidays, Happy New Year. "

She sent out delusional things that clearly showed that"" she was searching under corners for places  that not clean"" in her standards  for example   she   climbed on a chair to photograph an upper  shelf   wher my things on it .. o dast  on Bar of electrical outle...Or Minor fingerprints in a blender (blender that she obviously does not use..  Tracks of the window that are next the floor, And other nonsense I would never have thought of checking my maid She added:: I did not come in expecring the flat to be dirty so I did not inspect it when I arrived. But if you looking for reasons to discredit me, fine - airbnb asked me to contact you first to resolve it, otherwaise they will get involved! Again I suggested that  I clean dust etc And I arranged to meet with her at two in the afternoon. I came with my daughter and recorded the conversation and filmed the apartment that was brilliant and went after her and photographed what she showed (which looks as delusional for example  as the bathroom plug from inside she claims was dirty . In short, I offered her fifty percent of the cleaning fees  pitty that I didn’t read in the forum on this matter before. I would not suject her so much (reat that  It is acceptable to offer 5-10 percent . btw how airbnb can decide ? according to what standard?   The next day before she left I asked her to sign me a paper that she got  the money and that it would be a kind of agreement .. She was no there  but her husband came and he was surprised  of what she said and I told him that im sure shes doing this (""inspector work"") in other host places and that’s how she get back sometimes? The cleaning fees So I learned a lesson. Next time ill  ask the guest to sighn that the apt is clean and that he doesn’t have any compliments And of course she published a negative opinion, I didn’t write mine yet  so I ask the forum members what you think, what I should write about her back that other host will  know she opens drawers, not to mention going up on chairs to check if ther is dast on  shelves .."

Katherine845,20-07-2022 02:24 PM,"Sheffield, United Kingdom","Just wondered about other people's thoughts... I've seen a lot of articles recently with people complaining about Airbnb fees - especially the cleaning fee being an add-on. It's obviously something that immediately sets your offer apart from a hotel and I get why guests find it annoying.   However I include a fee because I want to be able to offer short stays that don't leave me out of pocket.    As it stands, the only way length of stay discounts are for a week or month plus bookings.   That means I'm left with a choice:   If I absorb the cleaning fee so it's spread over my minimum stay, an £80 cleaning fee split over two would mean my nightly rate would go up by £40... That way I wouldn't lose out on a two nighter, however those staying for 3/4/5 & nights would see the cost of their stays increase dramatically.   Or I take the hit on shorter stays.. Say increase the nightly rate by £15-20.. That would mean I'd lose out over a two nighter, but would have made the cleaning fee back over 4/5 nights...    What I would really like is for Airbnb to add bespoke length of stay reductions - so you could set a percentage reduction for a 3/4/5/6 night stay... That would mean I could get rid of the cleaning charge without being out of pocket.   What do other hosts think? And is there a way of effectively  flagging an idea like that up to Airbnb?"

Rikki6,10-08-2018 03:15 PM,"Estacada, OR","OK. So I have a serious question.   I just started hosting in June and I have farmhouse studio (with kitchen) that is out in the country in Oregon. Paying someone to clean would cause a trip fee that is just not worth it. Plus I only charge $82 per night. (and a $45 cleaning fee) What I really want to do, is ask for a cleaning deposit, and require/encourage guests to clean themselves.  - wash dishes - clean counters - strip beds - sweep the floor, etc   So all I have to do is laundry when a guest checks out! AND if the apartment looks like it is cleaned well, I can simply give guests back their deposit. I am hoping this encourages people to be cleaner during their whole stay! I have had my place looking like A MESS when people leave. Dirty dishes piled in the sink, candy wrappers on the floor, leftover dinner sitting uncovered and molding in the refrigerator, etc. It is honestly super surprising to me, that people are so untidy.    Anyway, is there a way I can have a cleaning deposit like I described? Does anyone do this?? It is successful??   Thanks in advance for your help!  "

Josh270,04-01-2019 02:23 AM,Australia,"Recently I got a bad review from a ""strange"" customer. She's from the Netherlands so I suppose her English even better than mine. I have two listings, one is a private room and one is a single bed in the living room, the house locates in the middle of Melbourne CBD so you can imagine how expensive of the rent.   She booked one night in the living room. Even though, I state very clearly that there is me, maybe one more guest in the private room and one in the living room (in this case is her) but she left the review that she didn't expect there is someone in the house except the host. She paid only AUD35/night plus AUD10 cleaning fee and she expected she can ""occupy"" the whole space? So she left me ""1 star"" review for ""inaccuracy"".   Then she said my home is clean but not ""super clean"" and also 1 star. ^#$@#$@%%. Also she complained about the notes in the house. Since I'm working full time so I have to leave the notes so the guests know what to do when I'm not at home, is it a problem????   And again 3 star for communication because she blamed my listing is not correct, she didn't expect someone else in the house.   When she came, she washed all of her backpacker clothes after long days in different hostels and hand everywhere in my house, turn on the fan whole night to let it dry off quickly. Sometimes I don't understand some humans, especially come from the privillege countries like Netherlands. Can someone be a bit human being so this world can be a better world??   I have 70 reviews and all good but her review and attitude really let me down. I spoke to Airbnb 3 times and of course they do NOTHING and kept saying it's not violate the policy.   She's also the host on Airbnb, I hope she read this message and I hope one day you will have a similar guest at your place. I'm a Buddhist, I'm strongly believe in karma, trust me..   Her review: ""I slept here one night. The room was small but ok. There was another guest in this small place who i not expected.. i could use the bathroom, kitchen, washing machine and gym. That was all ok but in the house are everywhere papers with rules so its a real rental place. Josh is very friendly and nice person! Appartement was clean but not super clean.. its a cheap place for a overnight stay!"" (1 star for accuracy, 1 star for cleanliness, 3 star for communication, the rest 5 star => overall 3 star)  "

Simon690,18-11-2020 03:05 PM,"Hove, United Kingdom","Had a guest who originally booked for a month, then extended to 2, then to 3, then added a final extra week.  All good, and glad for the business.  To recognise the guest's long stay i offered a reduced rate for the extra week - being the first week of the calendar month I was even hesitant to allow this week to be booked, as many guests are looking for exact calendar month stays.   One week before checkout I reminded the guest of the terms with regards the end of stay clean (which are also detailed in the listing). A 2-hour post-stay clean is included in the price paid, but if additional hours are required these will be billed at £18/hr (had the booking originally been for 3 months I would most likely have increased the cleaning charge to cover more hours).  Most previous guests have left the property requiring less than, or if more than 2hours, only slightly.  Rarely have i had to charge for additional hours.  Of course, the charge is within my gift to waive should I feel the guest merits it (for being easy to deal with/ going above and beyond were issues to have arisen).   At checkout, it becomes apparent that the guest has done zero cleaning, which after a 3-month stay means there is a considerable amount of work needed to restore the property to the required condition for the next guest who arrives midday the next day (24 hours later).  I take some photos of some of the issues, and get stuck in.  Nowhere has been touched.  Bathroom, bedroom, sitting room, kitchen, hallway, deep dirt everywhere.  8 hours later (at 8pm) i finally stop for the night.  I message the guest to say I was surprised at the condition the property was left in.  No response.  Next morning, as I am still cleaning and preparing for the next guest, I sent a payment request for 3 additional hours cleaning (half of the extra 6, as a compromise).  The guest refuses to pay, says that it is mean spirited of me to ask for more money after the amount they had paid for the 3 months, and in any case, the property was not dirty to require so much time to clean.   The guest also says that they are not prepared to pay for my time - the additional charge should only be for a professional cleaner.   Escalating to Airbnb achieves nothing, they side with the guest, my photos were insufficient to backup my claim.     I am dumbfounded.  Where is the host support?  What proof would suffice?  My time has value, and as i don't know how long it will take to do the post-stay clean it makes no sense to employ a cleaner.  In any case, I am no slouch when it comes to preparing a property - the charge made is fair.   Have lost all confidence in Airbnb to adjudicate issues.  And for guests to respect the house rules they sign up to when they book.   Constructive thoughts welcome."

Geoff22,01-03-2019 10:30 PM,"Bellevue, WA","Our guests that left today cooked some rice cereal on high, the cereal overflowed into the burner pan, left a cooked on mess and the heat was so high it discolored the metal underneath.

Anyway I think he owes me at least $10 for the bother of extra cleaning and/or replacing that pan.  Not sure the best way to proceed:  Request funds that may or may not be sent?  Go to airbnb and ask for damages?   And if I was to request money from the guest I'm thinking after reviews would be better timing but have not done this before, so looking for some advice.   PS: they didn't do the best job of ""leaving it as you found it"" elsewhere with empty water bottles, small bits of trash, and the towels and pillows scattered all over the place.

Cami17,21-08-2019 07:24 PM,"Tucson, AZ","Hello fellow hosts!   I am looking for some insight regarding cleaning services for those who manage their property remotely. My place is in Tucson and I live in New Mexico - I had a friend that was cleaning it at $30/hour which I thought was a little high, especially cause she didn't provide her own cleaning products and some days she would take 6 hours to clean. Our place is booked about 70% of the year and I have a lot of short term guests where some months I have 4-6 turns. I originally was only charging a $75 cleaning fee to guests but quickly was loosing lots of money, plus we were charging pretty cheap per/night as it was. I upped the cleaning fee to $125 which covered a good portion of my cleaners salary - but again, still feel like majority of our income was going to paying her as well as paying for the cleaning products.. I also feel like I am getting less bookings because of the cost of our cleaning fee?

Elizabeth1426,07-08-2019 01:57 PM,"Lowell, MA",Are cleaning fees calculated daily or by the entire stay? For example it makes sense to ask for a $10 cleaning fee from a guest that stays fro one day only. But would you then expect $ 100 from a guest that stays 10 days or the same amount? Thanks.

Joel1021,03-04-2024 09:43 PM,"Davenport, CA",Clearly ABNB wants us to ditch it.  They just reported that 40% of all hosts have dropped it and they are saying they will bump hosts up who do.  My bookings are down so I do need to do something.  My issue is my cleaning cost is high at $250 and I'm not sure how to spread that out in a way that makes sense.  My average booking is 4.2 days but I have lots of 3 night stays and a handful of 9-10 night stays.  Id like to hear back from hosts in similar situation who have gotten rid of their cleaning fee.  I tried adding $60 per day and removing the $250 charge  and a 10% discount over 6 days but that doesnt add up right.  My head hurt from all the math   Thanks

James1559,30-05-2019 03:29 PM,"Santa Clarita, CA","I recently checked out of my 1st Airbnb stay. The next day I get a call from the host asking an extra $90 because the home required extra cleaning. I was beyond shocked! I stayed at the home for 2 months & I tried to tidy up, but I wasn’t going to leave it sparkingling clean. I left a couple of boxes by the front door so they could easily throw them away. The host sent me pictures & they are ridiculous! One of the pictures is the dining room table with a handprint & another is ONE razor left in the bathroom. Before I left the home, I even washed all the towels & dried them. I don’t understand how a host can have the audacity to ask for extra money. Mind you when I 1st checked into the home I had no A/C for 2 weeks! I also found rat feces under the sink. I didn’t make a big deal out of it because I understand things can happen, but now I’m thinking I should of. I’m not quite sure what to do especially because I have a 2nd booking with them again for a month. Back story I needed a place to stay for 3 months due to work. "

Debra300,06-06-2020 04:39 PM,"Gros Islet, Saint Lucia","So, while Airbnb has been raising service fees, canceling reservations and issuing vouchers in an attempt make up for lost revenues, it appears that some other short-term rental related businesses have been working on their side-hustle, and are now offering online courses and issuing cleaning ""certifications"":  www.cleaningcertification.com.   The course material is only a compilation of information that is available to the general public from the WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic, etc.  For $20USD and 30 minutes of your time, you can get  a decal badge, similar to the Superhost badge, to display on your listing.   The course providers are spreading the word via affiliates to endorse and market their offerings in exchange for a 10% commission.  I am sure that eventually the larger OTAs such as Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, and probably Airbnb will buy-in after they are able to negotiate a higher commission.  Then, they too will promote this cleaning certification, or another one, to hosts and guests.    "
Wai2,08-06-2019 10:27 AM,"Alpharetta, GA","I’m preparing to be a new host. My apartment is a 2 beds 2 baths, about 800 sq ft. I m looking to charging $30 cleaning fee and I’m requesting guest to put all used dishes into the dishwasher, all trash into trash can and if if guest need to change the trash bag, then the full trash bag must be taken out.    That is all the cleaning I require. My only concern is what if some guest does not follow this simple rule? I’m thinking to add a rule that if used dishes and trash’s are left in the open, then an additional $10-$100 fee will be charge, depends on the amount of dishes and trash left behind. Does the rule sounds fair? I’m not asking the guest to clean the house for me, just don’t leave anything that attract any kind of bugs.

Laura2592,24-02-2020 05:02 PM,"Frederick, MD","I had a guest complain that a glass-topped table on our porch was ""dirty."" We are in the middle of winter and though I wipe off the surfaces on the porch between every guest (or every other depending) snow, rain, and dirt can blow onto them. It is an outdoor space after all. Likewise we have a deck and a patio near a fire pit that both have seating. We keep the cushions for the chairs inside, but the outdoor rug can get grimy and sometimes the surfaces may need to be wiped down before sitting. We have a landscaper who comes twice a month in the summer and as needed in spring/fall but we do not do a ""deep clean"" of outdoor spaces between every guest.  I was wondering if we should start or what other hosts do? As a guest myself I never expect anything outdoors to be immaculate, especially on a wooded lot in the middle of winter, but maybe that is not the norm? I know that some guests are not used to things like leaves falling, insect life, etc. Should we expand our cleaning routine to give outdoor space some extra attention?"

I have a renter who is leaving tomorrow, who paid a cleaning fee, but who is quite sick and unable to clean upon leaving the space tomorrow (ugh). She did offer to pay another cleaning fee because she’s unable to clean.   I may take her up on this, especially as I can’t return until the evening, now, due to not wanting to get sick… I also wonder, should I have two cleaning fees for a long rental, like a month or more? Should Airbnb guests have to clean? I always get it cleaned before they arrive, hence the cleaning fee, but unless they clean at the end of a month-long rental, it would be pretty dirty upon my return (Guests have typically been great so far—and I’m happy to do laundry, etc, upon my return).   Should I assess the place upon my return, tomorrow evening, and then decide whether or not to charge her another cleaning fee? Thanks for any advice on this situation, and for the future! "

P23,28-02-2019 06:42 AM,"Chicago, IL","My husband and I just finished our first long term stay (6 weeks) in a townhome that we had to ourselves. Our amazing host had a cleaner come in once a week to wash all of the sheets, bath towels and kitchen towels. The cleaner would make the bed with the clean linens, vacuum, mop floors, dust, clean the kitchen and bathrooms.   We are very tidy and kept the home spotless between the weekly house cleaning.    We left that host 3 days ago and immediately began our second long term stay (5 weeks) in another region of the country. We are in an entire house by ourselves again this time.   This host has not said anything about weekly cleaning, changing linens or towels. The House Rules are silent on the topic. There are extra sheets and towels in the linen closet. I assume they are clean or they wouldn’t be in the linen closet. However, every kitchen towel and cloth napkin in the house had dried food and/or grease on them and were just tossed in a kitchen drawer...I assume by prior guests. Sheesh.    It’s clear that whoever does the cleaning here does the minimum.  Accordingly, since nothing has been said and the cleaner isn’t very good anyway, I think we will handle our own weekly house cleaning including washing and changing our bed and bath linens.   I’d like guidance on what a long term guest might expect regarding weekly house cleaning and linen changes.  I’m not taking about dishes and daily living clean up. Please remember, this is only our second long term stay and we’ve had two opposite experiences. We want to know what to expect or ask for in the event any future hosts are silent on cleaning plans for long term guests. Thanks in advance. "

Annette76,16-03-2019 08:15 PM,"Cherry Log, GA",On another forum I was reading where an experienced host made a change to his listing that I found interesting. So apparently he had a few instances over the course of a year where guests ruined linens or caused damage and when he called to report he found that they don’t actually collect the listed deposit. He then had to go through he11 getting reimbursed (on one he didn’t as I recall). So then he changed his cleaning fee from $50 to $200. He then in the listing advises the guest that at checkout when he determines no damage and such that he will refund $150 and keep $50 for cleaning. He said he’s had great success with this change. He had a bit lower occupancy but the guests that did book left his space in much better shape than he’d become accustomed to. He also said he has kept part of it when there were more guests than booked. Of course his guest house is on site so he can see extra guests and can check the condition of the space himself.  I’m  thinking I may do the same and will also use the extra amount to collect my pet fee. Thoughts?

Inna22,18-05-2019 10:18 PM,"Chicago, IL","I have always had my own cleaner that I hired directly but the one I have had for almost a year went back to her country. I have been struggling for a month to find someone (they all want a set schedule) and so called a few services. The charge minimum $30 per hour and their assessment of how much time is needed to clean the place is well above what it took my cleaning person. For my two bedroom property, the cheapest I could find was $90 which is way beyond a reasonable cleaning fee I could get away with. Also, they like to send a team of two which means for smaller properties it is just not enough time for washer and dryer to run as they are done twice as fast. I see posts about looking for a cleaning service or hosts mentioning they use one all the time. I am trying to understand how it works for others. I would much rather get a service even if it is just a little more expensive as it is peace of mind of not relying on one person. I know and respect that those cleaners have to make a living and the company deserves a cut. I just don’t understand how others make it work."

Alex6406,09-02-2020 10:40 PM,"Kurraba Point, Australia",Hello our place is in a very remote area and cleaners are not willing to stay on and do the job we can only charge $75 for the cleaning fee & $115 for the night we can not afford to pay anymore than we do and the only cleaning company who services the area wants to charge $220 per clean.   So I am wondering how do other hosts handle this situation do you waiver the cleaning fee and asks the guests to clean the place? We also provide the linen maybe we should stop this practice and ask them to bring there own and clean the place themselves.  Can we add the option of linen and cleaning provided but for a higher fee if needed?  Thank you in advance for your help with this.
Peng7,06-06-2019 05:55 AM,"Montreal, Canada","Hi Guys,   I have been cleaning Airbnb for almost two years as i ran a cleaning service provider for the first year and now has grown the company into a full blown airbnb management service.    I would like to share some of the best practices that we use to do an efficient and effective cleaning.  1. Use lots of microfiber clothes for each clean. Clean one room with one clean towel avoids the cleaning with a dirty towel. The cleaner the towel is, the cleaner the final result of the surface will be. Furthermore, not going back and forth washing your towel gives you speed.    2. Use all-purpose solution and Windex solution. For all stainless steel surface, use Windex. For the rest of the house, you can pretty much use the all-purpose solution.   4. Use Moping Solution in the mope-basket but also it is better to use hot water as the base solution. The temperature of the water really releases the scent of the moping solution. Upon the completion of your moping, you will find your place full of delightful smells.   5. Open doors and windows at the start of the clean and use Air Refreshener at the end of each clean. A good smell really helps on a good first impression.    I will try to continue to share more of our practices. I hope to get some of your comments and feedback.    Thanks, Peng  "

I have dish soap, dishwasher tablets, liquid soap everywhere and hand sanitizer on the wall and my floors are so clean you could eat food off of them. I was accused of not caring about the guests health! Am I wrong here? I didn't want to leave bleach under the sink in case someone had a child and they accidentally drank it, plus I didn't want to leave materials guests could steal. I have guest steal toilet paper, towels, soap already (anything they can get their hands on). What do other hosts do? Do you leave cleaning supplies?

Melissa1208,03-12-2019 02:15 PM,"Long Eaton, United Kingdom","Hi everyone,    I recently stayed at a property in Greece where the cleaning fee was listed as 21 euros.  This was a large two-bedroom apartment with a dining room, living room, kitchen, entrance room, and bathroom.   I checked out of the apartment and cleaned it reasonably before leaving, though I didn't remove the sheets from the bed,  I admit I hurried away and left a plate rinsing in the sink, and some toiletries on the shelf in the bathroom. However, it was certainly NOT messy. I put all the linens in a pile and even swept the floors. The host left me a glowing review to say that the apartment was spotlessly clean when I left and I was welcome back at any time. She didn't message me about any issues and was friendly in our final communications.    I hadn't heard anything more until Airbnb contacted me today, several days later and said that there was an additional cleaning fee of 160 euros! The host is out of the country and hired a professional cleaner that charged her 75 euros per hour plus admin fees, equating to two hours of work. 

This is an extortionate rate in my opinion, especially for a standard clean between guests and especially for Greece. I'm really angry that the host is trying to pass this fee onto me. It should have been listed outright. Airbnb sent me a photo to demonstrate the ""condition"" of the apartment that needed cleaning - it was a photo of an unmade bed and a photo of a few bottles of shower gel on the shelf. This is outrageous to me. I left the shower gels in case they could be used by another guest. I didn't think I'd get charged for this.    I have never had such an experience like this before. Of course, I disputed the fee but I don't want to pay another 160 euros when I have done nothing wrong and the host should have looked for a more economic cleaning service. I was a host in the past, and I know that you can get cleaners in the UK for 15 euros an hour, nevermind Greece! I don't believe there was a security deposit on the property. Can Airbnb just charge my account if they decide to agree with the host?    This is the icing on the cake of what was already a nightmare stay. The apartment was already quite expensive. To add to this, I found a cockroach in the apartment when I arrived. I sent images of it to the host and opened a cupboard to find cockroach traps and bug spray, so she was clearly aware of this issue. She suggested that I call pest control, but it was very inconvenient for me so I simply sprayed the place and removed the bugs when I saw them. I didn't ask for a refund, though I probably could have, but I messaged the host privately and left a comment about the cockroaches in the review. I cannot believe the nerve of this host after everything I went through with the bugs! After she requested the cleaning fee, I communicated this issue with the photos to Airbnb 

I'm travelling at the moment and feeling very stressed about it all.  "

Nancy1609,21-12-2021 12:10 PM,"New York, NY","Although it was the boyfriend  who made the booking he explained that it was his partner Lisa who would be checking in and he would join her later in the month. I was with my family when she checked in and so my husband greeted her & tried to run through some of the specifics like showing her the emergency exit & fire extinguisher and other things on our house rules guide to make it easier. He felt she was rushing him & so I sent her the house rules that he did not leave with her so she could refer to it for the things that he had not covered with her like the garbage & recycling schedule & specifying when ordering deliveries that it is the bottom unit not the upstairs.  Luckily I have a ring doorbell & found that there was a delivery made for her & left it on the front stoop for her a while. When she checked in she explained that she was stayed with friends somewhere else a few nights that week & be returning the following week. Then she stayed with friends for another week from 12/4-12/9 so I changed normal cleaning schedule around her so she would have a clean & fresh linens when she returned on morning of 12/9 before she returned that evening. 11 days later she contacted me because there was a problem with the locking mechanism as well as the door pull that had become loose & she was afraid not being able to turn the knob if it were to fall off. Then she added that the bathroom sink does not seem to drain very well. Her partner (who is the airbnb account holder)  has joined her at the studio as of last week.   I told her I would call & see about a lock smith but when she mentioned the sink my husband & I decided to call our handyman so he could handle both items. Our handyman was there in 3hrs with a new door pull & installed it. He then was to look at the sink but when he asked she said there was nothing else that needed his attention. It seemed that there was some miscommunication & was sending the handyman home thinking that my husband would take care of the sink later. I told her my husband was working & that that is why we sent the handyman. During this time she also said that the Schlage lock was not working. I spent an hour with customer service to later find out that Larry or Lisa were inputting the wrong numbers repeatedly. She had input the wrong code 12 times & apparently after 4 mis keying it needs 30 seconds to reset. It’s a safety measure against tampering. I told her to let the lock rest for 30 seconds & try the correct code & that resolved the issue.   The next afternoon she contacted me that there were some issues that she wanted to discuss. She was low on a few things like toilet paper, paper towels, dishwashing liquid & out of hand soap in both the kitchen & bathroom.
Not a problem, I told her we would get that to her but in a bit. When discussing this with my husband we were confused because in over 10 years of hosting on a monthly basis no one has ever gone through as much supplies in less that a month not to mention she has not been there for one & a half weeks & the month had not finished & it’s only been her alone in the space until now that her boyfriend arrived to join her.   She had run out of a month’s supply of 2 - 7.5oz bottles of Softsoap, 7oz dishwashing liquid, plus the extra under the sink, 4 rolls of toilet paper & a roll & paper towels & and extra emergency roll that I keep under the sink. She explained that she doesn’t like to cross contaminate & she washes all the dishes after every course and throws away a sponge after each meal, I think she meant each day. When she explained that she uses the toilet paper for other things like makeup removal & perhaps cleaning other things I told her that by all means that that was her prerogative but that that was then up to her discretion & she was more than welcomed to buy as much soap, cleansers & paper products but that the cleaning service was not scheduled till the following week & that she would restock the normal monthly amount.   I explained to her that she has the right to wash her hands as many times & use 30 or more sponges a day & wash the dishes multiple times during her meals but that is her personal preference not to be at our expense.   Because of the holidays & the cleaning days landing 2 days before or after Christmas & The boyfriend  having mentioned when he booked the place that they had family in NJ and might be away a bit to visit.  I chose to schedule the cleaning on the 28th of December.  She texted that they would prefer to have the place service on 12/23. “You could always check with us before you make any future assumptions”. Followed by another text, “Fyi- I don’t think it’s reasonable to ask a person staying to use 2 oz hand soap for a month, let alone for a week is reasonable w/ COVID.” (This was the second time she mentioned 2oz of soap. I leave 7.5 bottles of Softsoap hand was in the kitchen & bathroom & another bottle of 7oz of dishwashing soap.) Since the boyfriend  was now staying at the place  I texted him that I would like to clear up a few things with him after I was done with work.   Since the Airbnb account is his & he is the one who booked it I would be communicating with him from this point on. He and I spoke and he seemed very  nice and thought it was silly that there was much to do about 2oz or 7oz of soap. I agreed and explained that there was no need for her tone in those messages from his girlfriend.
(I don’t think he was aware of her texts to me.)   The cleaning service has been rescheduled for tomorrow 12/22.
Exactly 2 weeks from the previous date that the place was freshens up & linens changed & exactly 30 days from the booking began. Like I said, we have been hosting for over 10 yrs as a monthly rental of our small studio.  1. i would like to ask how much soap, toilet paper & rolls of paper towels do people leave?   2. How often do you have the place cleaned & restock during a monthly stay?   3. How often do you change sheets & towels during a monthly stay?    "
Kelly---Jack0,08-03-2019 04:59 PM,"Orlando, FL","We are new to Airbnb and just had our 12th guest clean out the toiletries basket.   This is the first time that’s happened, previous guest have rightfully used an item or two but I was a little shocked to see the entire basket empty. We provide single sized items of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, body wash, bar soap. I put these items out for their use so I’m trying to be understanding but for them to use “everything” seems a little much. I’m wondering if this is worth including in their review. Additionally, this guest parked in our 1-car driveway leaving my boyfriend and I parked on the street all night. They arrived in the afternoon while we were both out, and we didn’t bother saying anything as we expected they’d go back out in the evening,  but they never did come out of the room after the arrived. We found it a bit presumptuous of them to leave their car there the entirety of their stay.   Is any of this worth putting in the review or should I just let it go?"
Bernadette82,05-09-2019 07:18 AM,"Las Vegas, NV","Is there a way to add an additional cleaning fee if they have children? What would be a cut off for that age? Could there be a refund offered of that cleaning fee if their kids didn't trash the place? There is usually washing of the walls, door handles, spot cleaning the carpet etc. After kids I usually have to vacuum all the creases in the two couches and behind the beds. So there is a suffient amount of time and extra cleaning supplies that go into the room to put it back together. Some kids are really clean and leave the usual crumbs expected but there have been kids that have thrown soda all over the walls and baby hand prints from some type of red candy all over the walls and wood blinds.

I moved the element of the sofa and saw a huge orange chemical stain. Now I understand why he didn't wanna move the sofa. I need to charge extra for cleaning the chemicals. How is it done? P.S.

I've noticed that some guests can be more messy than others. Some have room-keeping expectations typically associated with a stay at a hotel, while others are very respectful of the house and leave the place the way they found it. I realize that I can just start charging a cleaning fee, but this would also make my rates less competitive in the market and less desirable for guests. I want to include a message that addresses this within my communications with guests.

Sume1,25-05-2019 10:56 AM,N/A,"Hi all. So I booked a long term stay. I make it a point to check house rules every time as I like leaving the apartment as I found it. In this case, the house rules did not mention any cleaning. Now, my host says that in long stays she takes turn in cleaning with the host. Which also I am fine with as she has become a friend and I do not want her to do all the work alone. But she explained to me what all has to be cleaned - it involves deep cleaning and cleaning to make the apartment cleaner than I found it. She lives in the apartment too. I always do my dishes and I swept and mopped the floor of my room and the common spaces. But she wants me to brush the carpet in the staircase of the building (the stairs leading to her floor) and sweep and clean that too. Rinse decorative spaces kept near the main door. Take out oil stains in the kitchen - where I have not even used the kitchen much and I found it with oil stains. Deep clean the bathroom - toilet, drains and shower tiles. She doesn’t have a change of bed linen (so 1 sheet and 1 pillow cover for 8 weeks) and I had to wash it to keep my allergy at bay. For washing she prefers me to use the shortest cycle (15 minutes) and says my clothes would be fine but I am afraid it would spoil my clothes. She doesn’t want me to use the kettle much and light use the kitchen as “anything I break I will have to replace”. Basically she doesn’t want a smelly kitchen. The point is all this was not mentioned in the house rules (and she had mentioned that kitchen use was allowed for long stay, not “light kitchen use”). And of course I have paid cleaning fees and am paying more than the market rate for such a room. Which is fine as it is airbnb and I am not a flat mate but a guest. She has also other guests coming in for a couple of days next week although she mentioned in the house rules that the guest for my room would be sharing the bathroom only with her. I accepted that as I don’t have a say and she needs the money so I am ok with it.  I have become friends with her because of which I can’t behave like a wronged customer. So my question is that should I be doing all that cleaning? I would like to help out as otherwise she has to do it all by herself as she can’t afford a cleaner (or so it seems). But can she expect me to do all this stuff? And how do I maintain my stance without being rude? Also the check was weird. I estimated that I would be at her apartment by 11 (although I am a foreigner) had given her my flight number and all. The flight arrived on time and the commute took half an hour less. She was not there in her apartment as I had given an estimate of 11. I had to wait in a bar and drag 30 kg of luggage through the 300 m after 17 hours of travel. Is this good check-in behaviour by a host? "

Jenny,24-04-2023 10:32 AM,"Galashiels, United Kingdom","This topic is part of the Community Center Festival of Sustainability The original topic was posted in the Italian-speaking Community Center by @Barbara664  and we have translated it below. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  In our homes, we need to have cleaning that is guaranteed by quality products that protect our health and that of our planet. In my cleaning cart, you can always find bleach, alcohol vinegar, degreasing spray and the spray for cleaning the windows, but already for some time, I have devised a system to pay a little bit less for these products, which are known to be more expensive. So let me tell you:    Given that, unfortunately, although the water supplied by the municipality in this area is very high in limestone and is quite unpleasant, despite providing guests with a glass bottle, I often noticed that the guests left piles of plastic in the house, so I wrote instructions to ensure that the plastic bottles were all left in a container in the garden. This allows me to pick them up and take them to the nearest eco compactor with both economic and recycling benefits, as the return of empty plastic bottles produces points that are converted into discounts for environmentally friendly products!    Thanks to this initiative, the products I use for cleaning and the ones I leave for my guests are all environmentally friendly. It is a useful gesture of care for the planet!

Are there similar initiatives in your area?"

I don’t like to clean, I don’t want to clean and I’m not the best at it so I want to hire a cleaning company to do it. I’ve priced a vendor come at $55 per hour with an expectation of 2 to 4 hours to clean even after a one guest move out or check out. At $55 per hour that is more than what I’m charging for the 3-night weekend stay that I guest may book.   Can anybody give me an estimated price or how they make arrangements for a cleaning service to come in & do an adequately good job at a reasonable price? I considered having someone come in and clean and I do the laundry separately to save time. I’ve considered doing the Co-host status and paying a certain percentage but I’m not sure how diligent that person may be. I’d prefer a flat rate payment arrangement because the amount of cleaning varies depending on whether it’s one room or three bedrooms that need to be cleaned. Plus a flat rate allows me to budget adequately for my stays/expenses.  I would preferred to have some proven cleaning quality & consistency before I offer a co-host percentage. I do charge a cleaning fee per reservation but that nowhere near covers the cost expected by cleaning companies or cleaning persons.

Nick2001,23-09-2020 07:39 PM,"Mississauga, Canada","Hi everyone,    I am a new to Airbnb in regards to renting out a listing to guests, I will be within the next month listing a property for rent on Airbnb, and I was just wondering if anyone knows of a Cleaning Service that you know, or used before that I can use to clean my listing in-between guests. Or if there is anyone on here who owns a cleaning service. And can someone explain to me how the cleaning services work, and how the Service fee on AirBnb works when guests book the listing. What are guests generally responsible for, what is a reasonable Cleaning Fee for guests to pay? Is there a general rule for the amount of days you should allocate for cleaning before you allow another booking etc. Is it best to have everything in a description on the listing? Any information is much appreciated!   If you can let me know that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

Maia29,22-05-2020 01:21 AM,"Anchorage, AK","I provided space for a frontline worker. I automatically blocked six days on my calendar after they left. It's been 3 days since they checked out, and I will now clean it because I wanted to wait the maximum days before cleaning.    Now Airbnb won't allow me to check the ""I acknowledge that my Airbnb listing has been cleaned and disinfected according to the  guidelines listed above"".    It's freaking ridiculous. I thought customer service was going to be better, but I guess not. I actually have stricter guidelines for my unit and now, once again, I see Airbnb is in the process of trying to punish me.   Any advice?"
Beth44,18-03-2020 10:38 PM,"Flagstaff, AZ","During a couples' stay this week I was startled to repeatedly hear the husband's  loud sneezing and coughing through an attached apartment wall that usually acts as a sound barrier.  ( My airbnb is  at the back of my house.)     The guests  called me on the 3rd night of their stay (a week-long booking) to say they were leaving because of Covid news.  I understand their nervousness and the husband's condition made me likewise nervous. I could hear his sickness.   A few hours after they left, I donned a mask and rubber gloves to strip the bed, gather towels and empty the trash. I  sprayed all door handles, knobs and light switches with isopropyl alcohol. I steamed cleaned all laundry on a power wash setting. I have delayed entering the apartment for more than a day to complete cleaning which will include washing pillows, bed and throw blankets. I am concerned that I may have hosted a guest with a serious developing illness.   My question to the community is what other steps are recommended to protect ourselves and upcoming guests (should we ever have them again)? Cleaning up in the era of COVID has exceptional challenges!!!"

Shane321,28-01-2020 02:19 AM,N/A,"Hello all, Need some advice on when or when not to clean my hosted unit. I have a guest who reserved, 60 days.  I have a rule that we'll clean the unit every 2 weeks on Sunday afternoon.  During that time, I clean the bathroom and shower.  In the unit, I dust, vacuum, wipe down everything including windows ledge and also sweep and mop.  Usually there always something to clean, or something small to repair.  I normally give 24 - 48 hours notice of my entering unit.  My guest is tidy and clean by his standards, and insist on me not cleaning the unit unless he requests it.    Is there a rule of thumb of letting guests dictate if the unit should be cleaned or not? Does anyone here have experience in this area?  I want to accommodate the guest and make him feel welcomed, but I also don't want to be repairing stuff or cleaning for an extended period once they leave.     Any suggestions?  I would appreciate recommendations on how best to handle this. Trying to create a win/win end result.   Thank you in advance, S. "

Not only my housekeeper cleaned from top to bottom, I came in personally to make sure and put some final touches. I did not think the floors were clean enough and paid her overtime to rewash them all including every corner. At this point I think is more of an overall feeling by guests rather than anything specific. Do you have any tips for making a place feel fresh? "

Jennie131,19-10-2020 01:26 AM,"Rapid City, SD","I have read the cleaning handbook, and clicked through the ""Five Step Cleaning Protocol"" that we are all forced to agree to implement by November 20th. From what I can see, we are required to follow the ""best Practices"" in the cleaning handbook which include such things as washing walls, outdoor light fixtures, any and all dishes, pots, pans and utensils and extra blankets, towels and sheets that guests may have access to but not use between reservations.  Many hosts are protesting this, and other hosts are saying that we don't have to follow the handbook, or that it's simply ""best practice"" and if we deem it ""not possible"" then we don't have to do it.    Can I get an official statement confirming either we do or do not have to follow everything stated above? There is a lot of confusion here. For may of us, it would be impossible to follow. I'm not looking for hosts to comment that they agree or disagree, or to argue the point, I want an official word on this.   Thank you."
Joan2745,04-09-2022 08:54 PM,"Pleasant Hill, CA","Hi- I am a relatively new host, and I have a question about cleaning fees - after bad experiences with our initial cleaning company, we now have cleaners that are great - and charge about the same / going rate seemingly, as I called a few other companies and asked about their fee. I am in the midst of lowering our nightly rate for the Fall months, and in looking at comparable listings in our area, I was struck by the fact that most cleaning fees were lower (our cleaning fee is 250...which we currently have as the fee for the guests for cleaning)....most all of the other listings' cleaning fees in our area, are under 200.00. So I'm trying to figure out if I should lower the cleaning fee for guests (thus 'eating' some of the fee ourselves), or lower the Fall rate a little more than we were planning, to make the over-all fees for the guest, more comparable to others' listings in our area.   Any thoughts or advice on this? Thank you in advance!"

I don't want to offend them by asking them to stop as they may not be able to stop themselves however it is starting to bother me.  Any suggestions?   They are new to Air BnB and had no reviews.
